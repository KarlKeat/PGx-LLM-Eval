According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, individuals with increased function of SLCO1B1 (c.521T>C or c.388A>G variants) may require a lower dose of atorvastatin due to increased transport of the medication into the liver, resulting in increased systemic exposure. This may lead to an increased risk of muscle toxicity (myotoxicity). Therefore, clinicians should consider a reduced starting dose of atorvastatin and closely monitor patients for signs of myotoxicity.	-0.14027913	0.28907126	0.03794336	-0.16811368	0.047513288	-0.06754536	-0.12626610696315765	0.5002766847610474	0.1101914718747139	0.34554116731575263	0.4815393775746691	0.6016910377964034	0.4754832	0.40467146	0.46999148	0.40234104	0.6000042	0.621426	0.41745502	0.540591	0.5499445	0.4589698	0.5530089	0.6456954	0

Consideration should be given to alternative PPIs, such as lansoprazole or pantoprazole, which are metabolized by different CYP enzymes.	-0.1388046	-0.028029922	-0.08218288	-0.18399519	0.32151034	0.01655182	-0.1537829488515854	0.3014570474624634	0.03237840160727501	0.3062115396050245	0.5782131049492183	0.5652894362139037	0.3215087	0.54119056	0.5621863	0.27845472	0.49439394	0.5512066	0.29286137	0.55544823	0.61834896	0.34478903	0.59134585	0.6065959	0
omeprazole	CYP2C19	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Likely Intermediate Metabolizer for CYP2C19 with regards to taking omeprazole? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate standard starting daily dose. For chronic therapy (>12 weeks) and efficacy achieved, consider 50% reduction in daily dose and monitor for continued efficacy.	['Proceed taking omeprazole as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Avoid omeprazole. Take an alternate therapy.']	Take omeprazole with an altered dose.	According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, individuals who are likely intermediate metabolizers for CYP2C19 may require a moderate dose reduction of omeprazole, as they may have reduced enzyme activity leading to higher plasma concentrations of the drug. This is because CYP2C19 is responsible for the metabolism of omeprazole, and reduced activity may increase the risk of adverse effects. Therefore, clinicians may consider starting with a lower dose and titrating up to a maximum dose of 20 mg daily, with close monitoring of efficacy and toxicity.	-0.011964769	0.24883598	0.107688956	-0.13793266	0.44065344	0.086448096	-0.17934741079807281	0.21067474782466888	-0.015331043861806393	0.4804154699028455	0.6538382660605081	0.5639451816116989	0.38832328	0.54918116	0.51739657	0.41354623	0.5681735	0.636484	0.47891754	0.5244315	0.57719797	0.4935995	0.62342805	0.51918966	0

Based on the pharmacogenomics profile, a Possible Intermediate Metabolizer for TPMT and Normal Metabolizer for NUDT15, the clinical guidance for thioguanine therapy would be to initiate therapy with a reduced dose and close monitoring of thioguanine toxicity, due to the potential increased risk of myelosuppression associated with intermediate TPMT activity. However, the normal NUDT15 metabolizer status suggests a lower risk of thioguanine-induced myelosuppression, which may offset some of the risk associated with intermediate TPMT activity. Overall, careful dose titration and monitoring are recommended to balance the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity risk of thioguanine therapy.	0.072401695	-0.0035896972	0.03699702	-0.2610518	0.36821023	-0.030458687	-0.2428092211484909	0.13147446513175964	-0.08587925136089325	0.734579906227381	0.6380483801152873	0.6640973585591227	0.63813466	0.5116879	0.55164444	0.6645819	0.45113313	0.5612431	0.5641427	0.49333197	0.5466841	0.6377544	0.66802615	0.63026196	0

Increasing the target maintenance dose by 50% or more may be needed for efficacy.	['Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.	According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, individuals who are ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 (activity score ≥3.0) may require a dose reduction of vortioxetine due to increased metabolism and potential decreased efficacy. The recommended dose adjustment is to start with a lower dose and titrate to response, as these individuals may experience reduced exposure to the active metabolite of vortioxetine. Close monitoring of therapeutic response and adverse effects is also recommended.	0.15371102	0.30992216	0.23021503	-0.15707557	0.28338107	0.02422232	-0.12837642431259155	0.47711944580078125	0.10425203293561935	0.8044178217063327	0.616473007408808	0.719554495809692	0.7492175	0.58657163	0.57818997	0.79529226	0.6446082	0.6469805	0.8231399	0.58136314	0.5870509	0.7514314	0.64103276	0.6824741	0
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer and activity score = 1.0 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.	Based on the pharmacogenomic profile, as an Intermediate Metabolizer with a CYP2D6 activity score of 1.0, the patient is expected to metabolize vortioxetine normally. No dosage adjustment is recommended, and the standard dosing regimen can be followed. However, it is essential to monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust the dosage as needed based on clinical response and tolerability.	-0.0853355	0.19022667	0.039364588	-0.0768887	0.3205102	0.092289336	-0.12841151654720306	0.4400181174278259	0.09348835796117783	0.4352774036950431	0.6675683332534245	0.6663428207319843	0.35719603	0.63045186	0.5843702	0.3996866	0.68384755	0.6703183	0.46738788	0.6555886	0.6454878	0.53394496	0.69590163	0.6198846	1
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer and activity score = 0.5 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.	Based on the pharmacogenomics data, as an Intermediate Metabolizer with an activity score of 0.5 for CYP2D6, the clinical guidance for vortioxetine therapy would be to initiate treatment with a reduced dose and closely monitor for adverse effects, as vortioxetine is a CYP2D6 substrate and impaired metabolism may lead to increased exposure and toxicity. A starting dose of 5 mg daily, which is half the recommended dose, may be considered, with subsequent titration based on clinical response and tolerability. Furthermore, close monitoring of therapeutic response and potential adverse effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and somnolence, is essential to ensure safe and effective treatment.	-0.15083538	0.34113488	0.046992563	-0.2095892	0.0819809	-0.08061982	-0.16889919340610504	0.5025847554206848	0.07933532446622849	0.5515972532745774	0.615580955759274	0.7173705078050668	0.39864007	0.5761175	0.6145203	0.37477535	0.70303655	0.7030714	0.44884148	0.6163048	0.62222844	0.5972816	0.66185707	0.70933354	0
