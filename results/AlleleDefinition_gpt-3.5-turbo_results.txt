UGT1A1	*6	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *6? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs4148323	The UGT1A1 *6 allele is associated with two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) - rs6742078 and rs4148323. However, the most well-known and commonly used SNP for UGT1A1*6 is rs4148323. This SNP is the primary variant used to define the UGT1A1*6 allele.	['rs4148323', 'rs6742078']	0.5	1.0
UGT1A1	*37	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs3064744	The UGT1A1 *37 allele is defined by the c.211G>A substitution in the UGT1A1 gene. This variation leads to reduced enzymatic activity of the UGT1A1 protein, which is responsible for bilirubin metabolism. The dbSNP ID for this variation is rs4148323.	['rs4148323']	0.0	0.0
UGT1A1	*1	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *1? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs35350960;rs4148323;rs3064744	The UGT1A1 *1 allele is considered the wild-type or normal allele. It is characterized by the absence of specific variants in the UGT1A1 gene. One of the most well-known variants associated with UGT1A1 is rs8175347, which is commonly known as UGT1A1*28. This variant affects the transcriptional activity of the UGT1A1 gene and is associated with decreased enzyme activity.    Therefore, the absence of rs8175347 (UGT1A1*28) in the genotype would be indicative of the UGT1A1 *1 allele.	['rs8175347']	0.0	0.0
UGT1A1	*80+*37	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs3064744	The UGT1A1 *80+*37 allele is associated with the following SNPs: rs887829 or UGT1A1*37 (TA insertion in TATA box) and rs4148323 or UGT1A1*80 (A(TA)7TAA insertion in the TATAA box). These two SNPs contribute to reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity and are associated with Gilbert syndrome, a common form of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.	['rs4148323', 'rs887829']	0.5	0.5
VKORC1	rs9923231 variant (T)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 variant (T)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	The specific SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 variant (T) is not well-defined in the literature. The rsID rs9923231 represents a locus on the VKORC1 gene, but the specific SNPs within this variant are not specifically mentioned in available databases.     If further clarification is needed, I recommend consulting specialized databases or resources such as ClinVar, dbSNP, and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) for more detailed information on the genetic variations in VKORC1 rs9923231.

VKORC1	rs9923231 reference (C)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	VKORC1 rs9923231 is an important SNP associated with warfarin dosing. The reference allele for rs9923231 is (C). The SNP defines the haplotype block that includes the following SNPs:  - rs17708472 (A/G)  - rs2359612 (C/T)  - rs9934438 (C/T)  - rs8050894 (G/A)  - rs2359611 (A/G)    These SNPs are often found in linkage disequilibrium with rs9923231 and may have predictive value in warfarin dosing. However, the specific dbSNP IDs for these SNPs vary and are not always readily available.	['rs9934438', 'rs8050894', 'rs2359611', 'rs17708472', 'rs2359612', 'rs9923231']	0.16666666666666666	1.0
