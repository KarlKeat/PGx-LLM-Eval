Dosage adjustments may be necessary to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes.	-0.023451066	0.31230217	0.12470338	-0.06749853	0.14872332	0.033950552	-0.009897147305309772	0.5620614886283875	0.21841271221637726	0.48945445917465286	0.5868727566443573	0.69065300222166	0.4556965	0.5792491	0.60326535	0.4038884	0.67210984	0.6682233	0.44089627	0.5671676	0.57785153	0.49520898	0.59398735	0.66987455	0
