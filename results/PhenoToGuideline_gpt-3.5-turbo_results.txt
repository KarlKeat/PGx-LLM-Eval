abacavir	HLA-B	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is HLA-B*57:01 positive for HLA-B with regards to taking abacavir? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Abacavir is not recommended	['Proceed taking abacavir as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take abacavir with a reduced dose.', 'Take abacavir with an increased dose.']	Avoid abacavir. Take an alternate therapy.	For individuals who are HLA-B*57:01 positive, there is a significant risk of developing a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, a medication commonly used to treat HIV infection. Thus, it is recommended to avoid prescribing abacavir in these individuals due to the increased risk of severe adverse reactions such as fever, rash, and potentially life-threatening conditions like severe liver or kidney problems. Screening for HLA-B*57:01 prior to initiating abacavir therapy is recommended to minimize the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and improve patient safety.	0.69100609343136	0.7590662809135725	0.7479400437640393	0.6305131792673768	0.7512556	0.7781517	0.69347507	0.63235414	0.7234424	0.83611435	0.7775479	0.6760735	0.59388655	0.8141054	0.7101602	0.5847625	0.6138821	0.8348719	0.68388987	0.63591677	1

Use abacavir per standard dosing guidelines	['Avoid abacavir. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take abacavir with a reduced dose.', 'Take abacavir with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking abacavir as normal. There is no recommendation.	For individuals who are HLA-B*57:01 negative, the risk of developing a severe hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir is extremely low. Therefore, for these individuals, abacavir can be safely considered as a treatment option for HIV infection, as long as there are no other contraindications present. Regular monitoring for adverse effects should still be conducted per standard clinical practice.	0.6399591810267816	0.7423717712059391	0.739037784899372	0.6184291442851438	0.6437509	0.615938	0.6371864	0.6435978	0.70903456	0.81842077	0.70092964	0.6805914	0.59045595	0.77097464	0.7008068	0.49423575	0.62313616	0.677821	0.6862624	0.59073925	1

Allopurinol is contraindicated	['Proceed taking allopurinol as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take allopurinol with a reduced dose.', 'Take allopurinol with an increased dose.']	Avoid allopurinol. Take an alternate therapy.	For individuals who are HLA-B*58:01 positive, there is strong evidence linking this genetic variant to an increased risk of developing severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) when taking allopurinol. The clinical guidance recommends avoiding allopurinol use in these individuals and considering alternative medications for gout management to minimize the risk of severe adverse reactions. Prior genetic testing for HLA-B*58:01 before initiating allopurinol therapy is recommended to guide personalized treatment decisions.	0.622634105268127	0.7545026572256232	0.7085925768723073	0.5858975513154642	0.705227	0.76679975	0.6530145	0.60955375	0.6238905	0.82667464	0.66951466	0.60586685	0.43148667	0.7028648	0.59876686	0.4759162	0.64654803	0.6549111	0.61749643	0.64583087	1

Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take allopurinol with a reduced dose.', 'Take allopurinol with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking allopurinol as normal. There is no recommendation.	For individuals who are HLA-B*58:01 negative, the risk of developing allopurinol-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis is lower compared to those who are positive for this allele. However, it is still recommended to monitor for signs of hypersensitivity reactions when initiating allopurinol therapy, as these severe reactions can occur in individuals irrespective of their HLA-B*58:01 status. Close monitoring and prompt discontinuation of allopurinol at the first sign of a severe skin reaction is advised.	0.5751249258964805	0.7484076173506446	0.718666789370288	0.5545854214237705	0.44127724	0.68156767	0.6525745	0.5052422	0.606469	0.83289593	0.7034952	0.570698	0.44040018	0.7821047	0.68069845	0.409875	0.6168941	0.7153088	0.64258885	0.59378767	0
