Take an alternate therapy.	For a patient identified as a Likely Poor Metabolizer for CYP2C19, clinical guidance suggests using escitalopram with caution, as reduced CYP2C19 activity can result in higher plasma levels of the drug, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects. It is recommended to start at a lower dose and carefully monitor the patient for therapeutic response and side effects, with dosage adjustments made as necessary.	0.7936191648624901	0.6059033473659288	0.6188979987264391	0.6411372844963248	0.7053231	0.55259454	0.46171066	0.5943094	0.77465314	0.50769204	0.39856717	0.6487098	0.7978631	0.654592	0.5856944	0.62256825	0.7979531	0.6138301	0.5987987	0.65010226	1
tramadol	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Indeterminate for CYP2D6 with regards to taking tramadol? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	No recommendation	['Avoid tramadol. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take tramadol with a reduced dose.', 'Take tramadol with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking tramadol as normal. There is no recommendation.	For someone who is Indeterminate for CYP2D6, clinical guidance suggests exercising caution when prescribing tramadol. Since tramadol is metabolized by CYP2D6 to its active form, indeterminate status may result in unpredictable efficacy and risk for side effects. Alternative pain management strategies or close monitoring are recommended to ensure patient safety and effective pain control.	0.23540053082037446	0.45997959404467054	0.1971600109963646	0.5689893934094261	0.1668911	0.29108882	0.15411814	0.6290778	0.049064495	0.15144762	0.060812067	0.59403086	0.0077991947	0.33317634	0.09190325	0.56260854	0.29055634	0.51242226	0.40023413	0.5816372	0
