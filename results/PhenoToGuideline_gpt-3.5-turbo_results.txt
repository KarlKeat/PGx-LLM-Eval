Start with reduced starting doses (30%-80% of normal dose) if normal starting dose is ≥ 75 mg/m2/day or ≥ 1.5 mg/kg/day (e.g., start at 22.5-60 mg/m2/day or 0.45-1.2 mg/kg/day) and adjust doses of mercaptopurine based on degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. Allow 2-4 weeks to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment. If myelosuppression occurs, and depending on other therapy, emphasis should be on reducing mercaptopurine over other agents (PMID 20354201,18685564, 8857546, 18987654, 20010622, 16401827, 11302950, 16530532, 9634537).

There is no recommendation.', 'Avoid mercaptopurine. Take an alternate therapy.']	Take mercaptopurine with an altered dose.	Patients who are Intermediate Metabolizers for both TPMT and NUDT15 are at increased risk of mercaptopurine toxicity due to reduced metabolism of the drug. Clinical guidance typically recommends reducing the initial dose of mercaptopurine by 30-50% and closely monitoring for signs of toxicity, such as myelosuppression. Dose adjustments should be made based on individual response and tolerability to minimize the risk of severe adverse effects.	0.17798012	-0.07265934	0.04238095	-0.04651612	0.35075352	0.1242484	tensor(-0.0235)	tensor(0.3480)	tensor(0.1383)	0.7328422968139195	0.6776984049338076	0.6721737831472956	0.51905596	0.4768538	0.49899372	0.67674106	0.485077	0.65702343	0.6763693	0.5495332	0.6289339	0.68609166	0.6875203	0.486486	1

['Avoid oxcarbazepine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take oxcarbazepine with a reduced dose.', 'Take oxcarbazepine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking oxcarbazepine as normal. There is no recommendation.	Patients who are HLA-B*15:02 positive are at an increased risk of developing severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) when taking the antiepileptic drug oxcarbazepine. Thus, it is recommended to avoid the use of oxcarbazepine in individuals who are positive for HLA-B*15:02 to prevent the occurrence of these serious skin reactions. Genetic testing for HLA-B*15:02 prior to initiating oxcarbazepine therapy can help identify at-risk individuals and guide treatment decisions.	0.10068414	0.14341475	0.12427414	-0.14822441	0.2734296	0.028616533	tensor(-0.1401)	tensor(0.3468)	tensor(0.0586)	0.6528239858524546	0.5360491962076431	0.5472377564472066	0.5948282	0.57017714	0.57381165	0.5388074	0.47445935	0.5987657	0.45519626	0.3692184	0.55886954	0.49202752	0.522689	0.54892606	0
