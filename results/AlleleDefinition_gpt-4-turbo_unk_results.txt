However, this specific mutation, m.663A>G, does not have a corresponding dbSNP ID (rsID) because mitochondrial variants are frequently not listed in the dbSNP database, which primarily catalogs nuclear DNA SNP variations.    Hence, to look up this particular mutation, you would typically use its specific designation (m.663A>G) rather than an rsID.

This mutation is particularly known for its association with increased sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics which can lead to non-syndromic mitochondrial deafness.    However, there is no rsID (Reference SNP ID from dbSNP database) available for this mitochondrial SNP because dbSNP primarily catalogs SNPs within the nuclear genome and often does not include mitochondrial variants.

Importantly, this typically means the absence of the variant known as UGT1A1*28, which is characterized by an additional thymine-adenine (TA) repeat in the TATA box of the UGT1A1 promoter (i.e., having six TA repeats, denoted as 6/6 in the promoter region, rather than the seven repeats common to UGT1A1*28). The particular SNPs for the common or *1 allele aren't usually specified because it is considered the wild-type or the typical phenotype.    For research or clinical references, the *1 allele is typically characterized as having the rs8175347 with the 6/6 genotype in the TA repeat region of the promoter. However, other specific dbSNP IDs might not be regularly denoted unless there are deviations or mutations that differ from the *1 allele’s wild-type function.
