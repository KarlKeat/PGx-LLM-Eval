Therefore, it may be prudent to consider alternative diabetes medications with a lower risk of causing severe hypoglycemia in these patients.	-0.07611643	0.10785933	0.011486956	-0.10132267	0.23782524	0.047329746	tensor(-0.1083)	tensor(0.3499)	tensor(0.0820)	0.4355968278473105	0.46186063799422616	0.4271683469412071	0.54705536	0.49243855	0.5571215	0.55504036	0.54460394	0.47607183	0.49617538	0.5454705	0.3938367	0.48875082	0.45267752	0.48714405	0
glyburide	G6PD	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Normal for G6PD with regards to taking glyburide? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	No reason to avoid based on G6PD status	['Avoid glyburide.
