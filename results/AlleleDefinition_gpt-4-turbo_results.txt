Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs1050829	Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects the enzyme G6PD, which is important for protecting red blood cells against oxidative damage. This deficiency can lead to hemolytic anemia under certain conditions, such as exposure to certain foods, infections, or medications.    The G6PD A- allele commonly refers to a variant form of G6PD that is associated with mild to moderate enzyme deficiency. It is prevalent in African populations. There are two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) commonly used to define the G6PD A- allele:    1. **G6PD A376G (rs1050829)** - This SNP results in a substitution of valine to methionine at position 202 of the enzyme. This polymorphism is one marker of the G6PD A allele but, by itself, often does not lead to severe enzyme deficiency.    2. **G6PD G202A (rs1050828)** - This SNP leads to a substitution of aspartic acid to asparagine at position 68 of the enzyme. This mutation typically occurs together with A376G in the G6PD A- allele and is associated with reduced G6PD activity.    Individuals carrying both SNPs (A376G and G202A) are usually classified as having G6PD A-, which is associated with approximately 10-60% of normal G6PD enzyme activity. This level of activity can lead to increased vulnerability to oxidative stresses but may be sufficient under normal conditions, thereby preventing chronic hemolysis.

This particular mutation has been associated with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness.    Regarding the SNP and dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID), mutations in the mitochondrial genome are not traditionally cataloged by dbSNP with rs numbers, as they typically catalog only nuclear DNA variants. Therefore, specific mitochondrial mutations, such as m.961T>del+Cn in MT-RNR1, generally do not have rsIDs.    For more detailed information regarding mitochondrial mutations, different databases and resources that specialize in mitochondrial DNA, such as MITOMAP or the Human Mitochondrial Genome Database, are preferred for accurate and detailed genetic data. These databases provide comprehensive information about mutations, including their locations, effects, frequencies, and associated clinical symptoms.	[]	0.0	0.0

This might be a misunderstanding or a mix of different alleles. It's important to ensure the correct and standard nomenclature for accurate pharmacogenetic analysis.    However, I can provide information on some common SNPs associated with UGT1A1 that are widely studied for their pharmacogenetic implications:    1. **UGT1A1*28** - This allele involves a variation in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene, specifically a variation known as the TA repeat polymorphism in the TATA box. The standard (wild-type) sequence has 6 repeats (TA)6TAA, whereas the UGT1A1*28 allele has 7 repeats (TA)7TAA. This is known as the rs8175347. An increase in the number of TA repeats is associated with reduced transcriptional activity of the UGT1A1 gene, which can lead to lower enzyme activity.    2. **UGT1A1*80** - This naming could be a misunderstanding or miscommunication as it is not commonly referenced in widely used pharmacogenetic resources. It could potentially be confusion with other alleles or different variant designations.    If you're looking at combinations of alleles or haplotypes (e.g., *1/*28), understanding both the individual and combined impacts on drug metabolism is important. The *28 allele, because of its effect in reducing the enzyme's activity, is often discussed in the context of drugs such as irinotecan, a chemotherapy agent, where reduced UGT1A1 activity can lead to increased toxicity.    If UGT1A1 *80+*28 was intended to reflect a specific haplotype or a combination of mutations, it would be helpful to revisit the source to clarify the correct alleles and their respective SNPs for a precise response. For accurate pharmacogenetic interpretation and recommendation, using the standard nomenclature and understanding each allele's impact on enzyme activity is crucial.	['rs8175347']	0.0	0.0

Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs4148323;rs887829;rs3064744;rs35350960	The UGT1A1*1 allele is considered the wild-type or reference allele in the UGT1A1 gene, which encodes the enzyme UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1. This enzyme is primarily involved in the glucuronidation and detoxification of bilirubin and drugs. The UGT1A1*1 allele generally signifies normal enzyme activity.    Important to understanding the definition of UGT1A1*1, this allele is characterized by having the normal number of TA repeats (typically 6 repeats, represented as TA6) in the TATA box of the UGT1A1 promoter region. This specific repeat region is important as variations in the number of repeats affect the expression levels of the enzyme.    For clarifying rsID associated with UGT1A1*1:    - The SNP commonly associated with the TA repeat number in the TATA box does not have a typical rsID because it is a tandem repeat variation rather than a single nucleotide polymorphism. However, this information about TA repeats (whether 6 or 7 repeats) is crucial for determining genotypes like UGT1A1*28 (commonly 7 repeats, associated with reduced activity).    Outside of this TATA box region, other potential SNPs in the gene could be considered as part of the normal sequence for UGT1A1*1, though they are not defining the *1 allele specifically. Since UGT1A1*1 represents the wild-type configuration, any deviations typically define other alleles (like UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, etc.) associated with different enzymatic activity profiles.    Therefore, when discussing UGT1A1*1 specifically in a pharmacogenomics context, it is important to refer mostly to the TA repeat count, which is the critical element defining this allele, and lacking a specific rsID as would other types of genetic variants. For other SNPs that might be part of the broader genetic sequence, you can consult databases like the NCBI dbSNP, but these are not exclusive or defining of UGT1A1*1.	[]	0.0	0.0
UGT1A1	*80+*37	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs3064744	The UGT1A1 *80+*37 allele is characterized by the presence of specific SNP variants:    1. UGT1A1*80 corresponds to a thymine (T) nucleotide insertion in the A(TA)6TAA motif in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene, thus altering it to A(TA)7TAA. The rsID associated with this variant is rs8175347.    2. UGT1A1*37 typically refers to a particular SNP change where the nucleotide cytosine (C) is replaced by adenine (A) at position 211, which results in a change in the amino acid sequence from glycine to aspartic acid at position 71 (Gly71Asp). The rsID for this SNP is rs4148323.    Combining these polymorphisms indicates a particular allele of the UGT1A1 gene that may affect the metabolism of certain drugs and could influence treatment decisions in a clinical setting, mainly due to altered glucuronidation capacity. If using these genotypes in clinical assessments, specifically check with laboratory standards and guidelines as they can influence interpretation and therapeutic decisions.

VKORC1	rs9923231 variant (T)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 variant (T)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	"The VKORC1 rs9923231 variant, also known under the dbSNP ID rs9923231, refers to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the VKORC1 gene. This particular SNP is characterized by a guanine (G) to adenine (A) substitution at position 1639 in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene (using the reference sequence NM_024006.6 with position numbering that assumes the transcription start site as +1).    This variant can affect the functionality of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1, which is important for the biological activation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. The presence of the A allele (minor allele) has been associated with lower enzyme activity and reduced vitamin K recycling compared to the G allele. This genetic variation is significant for determining warfarin dosage as individuals with the A allele generally require lower doses of the medication to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation.    In the context of the question, the variant itself (rs9923231, T) in the typical dbSNP nomenclature refers specifically to the presence of the ancestral G allele at this position since ""T"" stands for the nucleotide thymine, which pairs with adenine on the opposing DNA strand. Therefore, the -1639G>T variant in VKORC1 is one where thymine is present on one strand (thus adenine on the complementary strand), and it is commonly referred to as -1639G>A when discussing the non-strand specific notation. The SNP rs9923231 is particularly well studied due to its pharmacogenomic implications in warfarin dosing.     If detailed allele definitions or haplotypes including rs9923231 are required, these would typically be based on the broader genotypic context or additional adjacent SNPs, which is something that databases like dbSNP, PharmGKB, or specific pharmacogenomic testing panels might provide. However, the core identifier for the allele at this location remains rs9923231."	['rs9923231']	1.0	1.0
VKORC1	rs9923231 reference (C)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	The VKORC1 rs9923231 SNP, often referred to as -1639G>A depending on the orientation relative to the gene, is an important genetic variant that influences warfarin dosing. The reference allele for rs9923231 is the G allele, and the variant allele is A. This SNP is located in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene, and the variant allele (A) has been associated with lower expression of VKORC1, resulting in increased sensitivity to warfarin.    As for other SNPs included in the allele definition, rs9923231 itself is specifically defined by the presence of the G (reference) or A (variant) allele at this position. No additional SNPs are part of this specific allele definition; it is defined solely by the G>A change at the rs9923231 location.    If you are asking about other SNPs that might be in linkage disequilibrium with rs9923231 or nearby, there are several, but these are not part of the rs9923231 allele definition itself. For example, rs9934438 and rs2359612 are other SNPs in VKORC1 that also affect warfarin dosing and are often studied in conjunction with rs9923231. However, each SNP has its distinct rsID and genetic variation.    If you need information on interactions or combined effects of multiple SNPs within VKORC1 for pharmacogenomic purposes, these would need to be analyzed as combinations or haplotypes rather than under a single SNP allele definition.
