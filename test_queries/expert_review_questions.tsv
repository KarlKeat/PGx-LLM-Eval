Are there any PGx biomarkers I can use to guide methadone dosing?	The evidence for the association of methadone and candidate genes CYP2D6, COMT, and OPRM1 is at level C as assigned by CPIC, which means the published studies contain mostly weak evidence and clinical actions are unclear. Therefore, there are no clinical recommendations regarding dose modification for methadone based on PGx markers.	Clinical PGx service	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/opioids/2020/33387367.pdf	Yes, there are pharmacogenomic (PGx) biomarkers that can help guide methadone dosing. Methadone is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent CYP3A4, among others. Variations in the genes encoding these enzymes can affect the metabolism and, consequently, the plasma levels of methadone, influencing both its efficacy and the risk of adverse effects.    Here are some key biomarkers and their potential implications:    1. **CYP2B6**:     - *Polymorphisms*: Variants such as CYP2B6*6 and CYP2B6*18 can reduce enzyme activity.     - *Implications*: Individuals carrying these variants may have higher plasma levels of methadone, increasing the risk of adverse effects such as sedation and respiratory depression. Dose adjustments may be necessary.    2. **CYP2D6**:     - *Polymorphisms*: Extensive metabolizer (EM), intermediate metabolizer (IM), poor metabolizer (PM), and ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) statuses are defined based on the presence of certain alleles, such as CYP2D6*3, *4, *5 (PM alleles), and CYP2D6*1xN, *2xN (UM alleles).     - *Implications*: CYP2D6 PMs may have higher methadone plasma levels, while UMs may have lower levels. However, the impact of CYP2D6 on methadone metabolism is less significant than that of CYP2B6.    3. **CYP3A4**:     - *Polymorphisms*: While generally less polymorphic, certain alleles and individuals with decreased CYP3A4 activity may experience altered methadone metabolism.     - *Implications*: Drug interactions that inhibit or induce CYP3A4 can significantly impact methadone levels.    4. **ABCB1 (MDR1)**:     - *Polymorphisms*: The ABCB1 gene encodes P-glycoprotein, which influences drug transport across cell membranes. Polymorphisms such as 3435C>T may affect methadone absorption and distribution.     - *Implications*: Certain variants might impact methadone pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, although the clinical significance is less well established compared to CYP450 enzymes.    In practice, **CYP2B6** genotype is the most relevant for clinical consideration concerning methadone dosing. Genetic testing can provide insight into how an individual might metabolize methadone and help tailor the dose to achieve optimal therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse effects.    It’s essential to combine these pharmacogenomic insights with other clinical factors, such as the patient's clinical history, concurrent medications, comorbid conditions, and overall treatment goals. Always consult with a healthcare provider or clinical pharmacogenomics expert when interpreting genetic test results and implementing them into clinical practice.	human
Which patient populations is testing for HLA-B *58:01 important and which drugs are impacted?	HLA-B *58:01 is associated with the risk of severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) with allopurinol. This allele is most commonly found in individuals of Asian descent (>10%) including Chinese, Taiwanese, Thai, Malaysian, and Indian. It can be found in African ancestry populations at a rate of 5-10%, and 1-5% of Japanese, Korean, South American, and European populations. The 2020 American College of Rheumatology Guidelines for Management of Gout recommends testing for the HLA-B*58:01 allele in selected subpopulations with elevated risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (individuals of Korean descent with stage 3 or worse chronic kidney disease, and those of Han-Chinese or Thai descent) prior to initiation of the drug. The FDA label also recommends testing for HLA-B 5801 in at risk populations prior to starting the drug. “The HLA-B*58:01 allele is a genetic marker for severe skin reactions indicative of hypersensitivity to allopurinol. Patients who carry the HLA-B*58:01 allele are at a higher risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS), but hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in patients who do not carry this allele. The frequency of this allele is higher in individuals of African, Asian (e.g., Han Chinese, Korean, Thai), and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander ancestry. Prior to starting allopurinol, consider testing for the HLA-B*58:01 allele in genetically at-risk populations. The use of allopurinol is not recommended in HLA-B*58:01 positive patients unless the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.”	Clinical PGx service	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/allopurinol/2013/23232549.pdf	Testing for the HLA-B *58:01 allele is particularly important for patient populations at risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) to certain drugs, specifically allopurinol. The populations most significantly impacted are:    1. **Asian Populations**: These include individuals of Han Chinese, Korean, and Thai descent, where the prevalence of the HLA-B *58:01 allele is relatively high. Testing is strongly recommended before initiating allopurinol therapy in these populations due to the heightened risk of serious reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).    2. **Other At-Risk Populations**: While the allele is less prevalent, testing may also be considered in patients of African ancestry and individuals from other ethnic backgrounds, as they may still carry the HLA-B *58:01 allele and be at increased risk for SCARs.    ### Drugs Impacted    **Allopurinol**: Allopurinol is commonly used to treat gout and hyperuricemia. Patients who test positive for the HLA-B *58:01 allele are at a significantly increased risk of developing SCARs, including SJS/TEN, when treated with allopurinol. Therefore, alternative medications should be considered for these patients if they test positive for this allele.    ### Recommendations    - **Pre-therapy Genetic Testing**: For Asian populations and other high-risk groups, genetic testing for the HLA-B *58:01 allele before starting allopurinol therapy is recommended.  - **Alternative Treatments**: If a patient tests positive for HLA-B *58:01, alternative medications such as febuxostat (for gout) should be considered to avoid the risk of SCARs.    Adherence to these recommendations helps in personalizing treatment plans and enhancing patient safety by reducing the likelihood of severe adverse drug reactions.	human
I would like to start my patient on an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for anxiety, are there any pgx tests I can order to help me guide therapy?	Yes, pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing can be useful in guiding the selection and dosing of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for treating anxiety. Several genes are particularly relevant:    1. **CYP2C19**: This enzyme metabolizes SSRIs like citalopram, escitalopram, and sertraline. Variants in the CYP2C19 gene can classify individuals into different metabolizer statuses: ultra-rapid, extensive (normal), intermediate, or poor metabolizers. For example, poor metabolizers may have a higher risk of drug accumulation and side effects, whereas ultra-rapid metabolizers may not reach therapeutic levels at standard doses.    2. **CYP2D6**: This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of other SSRIs such as fluoxetine and paroxetine. Similar to CYP2C19, variant alleles can lead to classifications like poor, intermediate, extensive (normal), or ultra-rapid metabolizers. This can impact drug efficacy and tolerability.    3. **SLC6A4**: The serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4) promoter region contains a polymorphism known as 5-HTTLPR, which includes a long (L) and a short (S) allele. This polymorphism can influence SSRI response. Individuals with the S/S genotype may have a lower response to SSRIs and a higher risk of side effects compared to those with the L/L genotype.    4. **HTR2A**: Variants in the HTR2A gene, which encodes one of the serotonin receptors, may also affect individual responses to SSRIs. Specific polymorphisms may be associated with differential treatment outcomes.    Clinical guidelines such as those provided by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) or other professional organizations can help interpret these genetic results and provide recommendations for tailoring SSRI therapy based on the patient's genetic makeup.    Before ordering PGx tests, it is important to counsel your patient on what the testing involves, its potential benefits, and any limitations. Additionally, consider integrating PGx test results with clinical factors like previous treatment history, comorbidities, and patient preferences to make the most informed treatment decisions.	Clinical PGx service	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor_antidepressants/2023/37032427.pdf	Based on the CPIC guidelines, genes that are known to affect SSRI metabolism are CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP2B6. CYP2B6 and CYP2C19 affects the metabolism of sertraline. CYP2D6 affects the metabolism of paroxetine, fluvoxamine and vortioxetine.  CYP2C19 affects the metabolism of citalopram and escitalopram.	gpt-4o
My patient had PGx testing done and said they are a CYP2C19 poor metabolizer but I want to prescribe clopidogrel. What is the interaction?	Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet medication that requires metabolic activation to exert its therapeutic effect. The enzyme CYP2C19 is crucial in this bioactivation process. Specifically, CYP2C19 converts clopidogrel into its active metabolite.    For patients identified as CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, the enzyme's reduced function leads to less conversion of clopidogrel into its active form. Consequently, this can result in subtherapeutic levels of the active metabolite, thereby reducing clopidogrel's efficacy in preventing thrombotic events such as heart attacks and strokes.    Guidelines, including those from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), recommend considering alternative antiplatelet agents such as prasugrel or ticagrelor for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. These alternatives do not rely on CYP2C19 for activation and can provide more consistent antiplatelet effects in these patients.    In summary, prescribing clopidogrel for a CYP2C19 poor metabolizer may be ineffective in preventing thrombotic events. It is advisable to consider alternative medications that do not depend on CYP2C19 metabolism for antiplatelet activity.	Clinical PGx service	https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-clopidogrel-and-cyp2c19/	Clopidogrel is a prodrug and must be metabolized by CYP2C19 into the active form, clopidogrel thiol H4, in order to irreversibly bind to platelet P2Y12 receptors and prevent clot formation. Per the current CPIC guidelines, patients who are CYP2C19 poor metabolizers have significantly reduced CYP2C19 activity, and should avoid clopidogrel if possible due to increased risk of adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.	gpt-4o
My patient had PGx testing done and they have SLCO1B1 decreased function. Can they still get a statin?	A patient with SLCO1B1 decreased function phenotype has higher systemic statin exposure, which may increase their risk of myopathy. However this does not mean a patient should completely avoid statin therapy. Based on the current CPIC guidelines, the dosing recommendations for each statin in patients who have decreased SLCO1B1 function are as follows: Atorvastatin: Prescribe ≤40 mg as a starting dose and adjust doses of atorvastatin based on disease- specific guidelines. Prescriber should be aware of possible increased risk for myopathy especially for 40- mg dose. If dose >40 mg needed for desired efficacy, consider combination therapy (i.e., atorvastatin plus nonstatin guideline- directed medical therapy. Fluvastatin: Prescribe desired starting dose and adjust doses of fluvastatin based on disease- specific guidelines. Prescriber should be aware of possible increased risk for myopathy especially for doses >40 mg per day. Lovastatin: Prescribe an alternative statin depending on the desired potency (see Figure 1 for recommendations for alternative statins). If lovastatin therapy is warranted, limit dose to ≤20 mg/day.	Clinical PGx service	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/statins/2022/publication.pdf	The SLCO1B1 gene encodes the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) protein, which plays a significant role in the hepatic uptake of various statins. Variants in the SLCO1B1 gene, particularly the SLCO1B1*5 (c.521T>C) allele, are associated with reduced transporter function. This can lead to increased plasma concentrations of statins, especially simvastatin, and subsequently a higher risk of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS).    Here are some key points to consider for your patient with decreased SLCO1B1 function:    1. **Simvastatin**: Patients with decreased SLCO1B1 function are at a higher risk of developing statin-induced myopathy when taking simvastatin. For these patients, it's generally recommended to avoid simvastatin or use it at the lowest effective dose.    2. **Alternative Statins**: Other statins, such as pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and fluvastatin, are less dependent on the SLCO1B1 transporter for hepatic uptake. These statins may be a suitable alternative for patients with decreased SLCO1B1 function. However, individual tolerance and efficacy should still be monitored.    3. **Dose Adjustment**: If a statin that is more dependent on SLCO1B1 function (like atorvastatin) is necessary, consider starting at a lower dose and titrate up while monitoring for efficacy and potential muscle-related side effects.    4. **Monitoring**: Regardless of the statin chosen, it's important to closely monitor the patient for any signs of muscle pain, weakness, or other symptoms suggestive of SAMS. Creatine kinase (CK) levels can also be monitored if symptoms arise to assess for muscle injury.    To summarize, patients with decreased SLCO1B1 function can still be prescribed statins, but it may be preferable to select statins less dependent on SLCO1B1 for hepatic uptake or to adjust the dosage appropriately. Always consider the risk-benefit balance and ensure diligent monitoring for adverse effects. Consulting current clinical guidelines and pharmacogenomic resources can provide further tailored recommendations.	human
My patient underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and I want to prescribe clopidogrel. They had pharmacogenetic testing and are a CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer (*1/*17).  Do they need a different dose of clopidogrel from the standard 75 mg daily?	Clopidogrel, an antiplatelet medication, requires metabolic activation by the CYP2C19 enzyme, and genetic variations in CYP2C19 can affect drug response. Your patient is a CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer with the *1/*17 genotype.     Rapid metabolizers generally have increased enzymatic activity, leading to higher levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel. This can enhance the drug's efficacy but may also increase the risk of bleeding.    According to current clinical guidelines and evidence-based pharmacogenomics resources like CPIC (Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium), patients who are CYP2C19 rapid metabolizers (including *1/*17) typically do not need a different dose from the standard 75 mg daily. This is because rapid metabolizers usually achieve adequate platelet inhibition with the standard dose of clopidogrel.    Therefore, for your patient who is a CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer, the standard clopidogrel dose of 75 mg daily is generally appropriate. However, it's also crucial to monitor for signs of bleeding or other adverse effects, as well as to ensure the effectiveness of the medication through standard clinical follow-up practices.    As always, consider the entire clinical context, including potential interactions with other medications and patient-specific factors, when making dosing decisions.	Clinical PGx service	https://cpicpgx.org/guidelines/guideline-for-clopidogrel-and-cyp2c19/	Clopidogrel is converted to its active metabolite in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19. The CYP2C19 *17 allele has increased function. One normal function allele and one increased function allele results in a rapid metabolizer. Although rapid metabolizers could have lower on-treatment platelet reactivity while be treated with clopidogrel compared to someone who is a normal metabolizer, there is not enough clinical evidence to recommend a dose different from standard dosing.	gpt-4o
My patient recently had multi-gene pharmacogenetic testing performed. They are concerned because their results show them to be a UGT1A1 poor metabolizer and they are taking atazanavir. They have been taking a regimen with atazanavir for the past year that has been working well and without any side effects. Should I switch them to a different medication?	Atazanavir inhibits UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation of bilirubin and therefore can increase plasma indirect bilirubin concentrations. UGT1A1 poor metabolizers have a high likelihood of discontinuing atazanavir due to experiencing jaundice. Since the patient is doing well on this therapy and has not experienced jaundice, switching to a different regimen is not indicated at this time. The patient should be advised of the higher likelihood of jaundice in patients who are UGT1A1 poor metabolizers and are taking atazanavir in the case that this is a concern for them.	Clinical PGx service	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/atazanavir/2015/26417955.pdf	Atazanavir is an antiretroviral medication used in the treatment of HIV, and it is known to interact with the enzyme UGT1A1 (uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1). UGT1A1 is responsible for the glucuronidation and subsequent elimination of bilirubin. Patients who are poor metabolizers for UGT1A1 have reduced enzymatic activity, which can lead to increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin.     The most common clinical consequence of reduced UGT1A1 activity in patients taking atazanavir is hyperbilirubinemia, which can manifest as jaundice. However, this condition is generally benign and does not typically warrant discontinuation of atazanavir if the patient is tolerating the medication well and experiencing effective viral suppression.    Here are some key points to consider:    1. **Clinical Efficacy and Tolerability**: Since the patient has been on the atazanavir regimen for a year without any adverse effects and the regimen has been effective, this suggests that the treatment is working well for them.    2. **Monitoring**: Continue to monitor the patient's bilirubin levels and liver function tests, as is standard practice with atazanavir therapy. Elevated bilirubin levels may be expected, but in the absence of other liver abnormalities or clinically significant jaundice causing discomfort, no change in therapy is indicated.    3. **Patient Symptoms and Concerns**: Discuss with the patient any symptoms they might experience going forward and assure them that mild hyperbilirubinemia is a known and manageable side effect in the context of atazanavir therapy. Education about the condition may help alleviate their concerns.    4. **Clinical Guidelines and Expert Opinions**: Current guidelines do not mandate switching antiretroviral therapy solely based on the UGT1A1 poor metabolizer status if the patient is otherwise doing well on their current regimen.    Based on this information, it does not appear necessary to switch the patient to a different medication solely due to the UGT1A1 poor metabolizer status if they are currently doing well on atazanavir without any side effects. However, ongoing monitoring and patient education are crucial. Always consider personalized advice from a clinical pharmacist or a specialist in pharmacogenomics, especially when dealing with specific patient cases and complex medication regimens.	human
A patient was planned to start on tramadol for pain management, but it is noted in their chart that they are CYP2D6 poor metabolizer. I’m not too familiar with Pgx testing, could I get guidance on how that would impact their tramadol treatment?	Patient’s poor metabolizer results indicates that they have less CYPD26 enzymes to convert tramadol (Pro-drug) into its active metabolite, o-desmethyltramadol, therefore tramadol treatment would not be an effective analgesic for this patient’s pain. CPIC guidelines recommend alternative opioid medication such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, or morphine.	Clinical PGx service	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/opioids/2020/33387367.pdf	Tramadol is an opioid analgesic that is metabolized in the liver, primarily by the enzyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). The activity of the CYP2D6 enzyme can vary significantly among individuals due to genetic polymorphisms, leading to classifications such as poor metabolizers (PMs), intermediate metabolizers, extensive metabolizers (EMs), and ultra-rapid metabolizers (URMs).    As a medication, tramadol is a prodrug, meaning it requires metabolic conversion to become active. Specifically, CYP2D6 converts tramadol into its active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol (M1), which is primarily responsible for tramadol’s analgesic effects.    In patients who are CYP2D6 poor metabolizers:  1. **Reduced Conversion to Active Metabolite**: These patients have a markedly reduced capacity to convert tramadol to its active metabolite (M1), which significantly diminishes the pain relief efficacy of tramadol. In essence, a poor metabolizer may experience less analgesia.  2. **Increased Risk of Side Effects**: Due to the reduced conversion to M1, the parent drug (tramadol) might build up in the bloodstream. This accumulation could increase the risk of side effects such as nausea, dizziness, and other adverse reactions associated with tramadol itself.    **Clinical Guidance:**  1. **Alternative Analgesic**: Given the reduced efficacy and potential for increased side effects, it is generally advisable to consider an alternative pain management strategy for patients identified as CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. Options might include non-opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen), and potentially other opioids that do not rely on CYP2D6 for activation (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).  2. **Personalized Approach**: If an opioid is necessary, consider selecting one that is not significantly affected by CYP2D6 metabolism.   3. **Dosage Adjustments**: If tramadol is deemed necessary despite these considerations, close monitoring and potential dosage adjustments would be required to manage the therapeutic efficacy and minimize adverse effects. However, this is typically less preferred compared to switching to an alternative.    In summary, given the patient's status as a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer, it would be prudent to avoid tramadol and consider alternative medications for pain management to ensure effective and safe treatment. Consulting with a clinical pharmacologist or incorporating a multidisciplinary approach might provide additional tailored strategies for managing this patient's pain.	human
A CYP3A5 poor metabolizer patient and receiving a liver transplant, what tacrolimus adjustment would be appropriate for them?	Typically, with other CYP enzymes, an extensive metabolizer would be classified as a “normal” metabolizer, and, therefore, the drug dose would not change based on the patient’s genotype. However, in the case of CYP3A5 and tacrolimus, a CYP3A5 expresser (i.e., CYP3A5 extensive metabolizer or intermediate metabolizer) would require a higher recommended starting dose and the CYP3A5 nonexpresser (i.e., poor metabolizer) would require the standard recommended starting dose. Thus, for this patient that is “poor metabolizer”, CPIC guidelines recommend initiating standard dosing and titrating based on therapeutic levels.	Clinical PGx service	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/tacrolimus/2015/25801146.pdf	Tacrolimus is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A5. Genetic variations in the CYP3A5 gene can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus. Individuals can be classified as either extensive metabolizers (expressing CYP3A5) or poor metabolizers (non-expressors of CYP3A5).    In the context of a liver transplant, where the liver donor's and recipient's CYP3A5 genotypes must be considered:    1. **Recipient is a CYP3A5 Poor Metabolizer (non-expressor):** Poor metabolizers have reduced or non-functional CYP3A5 enzyme activity. Therefore, they typically require lower doses of tacrolimus since they cannot metabolize the drug as efficiently. Standard dosing could lead to higher drug levels, increasing the risk of toxicity.    2. **Donor Liver's CYP3A5 Status:** Post liver transplant, the metabolic capacity of the new liver (donor liver) takes precedence. So, you must ascertain the CYP3A5 status of the donor liver.    When the liver donor is also a poor metabolizer, the adjustment remains consistent:    - **Lower Starting Dose:** Often, it is recommended to start these patients on a lower dose of tacrolimus. Dosing recommendations can involve starting at standard doses but with more frequent monitoring and potential prompt adjustments based on blood tacrolimus levels to avoid toxicity.    For example, guidelines might recommend starting at 1/3rd to 1/2 of the standard dose if known before surgery, and adjusting based on therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM].    - **Frequent Monitoring:** Intensive monitoring of blood levels of tacrolimus (e.g., trough levels) should be conducted to adjust the dose appropriately. Therapeutic drug monitoring is typically performed regularly to maintain the dose within the therapeutic range, minimizing the risk of rejection and toxicity.    **Practical steps:**    1. **Initial Dose:** Begin with a lower than standard dose, often recommended to be significantly reduced (e.g., 1/3rd to 1/2 of the usual starting dose used for extensive metabolizers).  2. **Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM):** Frequent monitoring of tacrolimus blood levels to ensure they are within the therapeutic range.   3. **Adjustments Based on TDM:** Adjust the tacrolimus dose based on the measured trough levels to maintain appropriate therapeutic concentrations.    In clinical practice, a potential initial dose for a CYP3A5 poor metabolizer might be 0.1-0.15 mg/kg/day in divided doses, closely monitored and adjusted based on blood levels.    Conclusively, careful and frequent monitoring is key to ensure proper drug levels and avoid potential toxicity or under-dosing in this patient population. Always follow updated clinical guidelines and consult with a transplant pharmacologist or specialist for specific dosing adjustments.	human
What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Ultrarapid Metabolizer and activity score = ≥6.0 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking paroxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.

PhenoToGuideline	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/G6PD/2022/36049896.pdf	For individuals with an indeterminate G6PD status, it is generally advised to avoid treatment with tafenoquine due to the risk of hemolytic anemia. Given the potential severity of hemolysis in G6PD-deficient individuals, alternative treatments that do not pose a risk to those with uncertain G6PD activity should be considered. Confirmatory testing for G6PD deficiency is recommended to ensure safe prescribing practices.	human

What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Uncertain Susceptibility for RYR1 and Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility for CACNA1S with regards to taking methoxyflurane? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Halogenated volatile anesthetics or the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine are relatively contraindicated in persons with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS). They should not be used, except in extraordinary circumstances where the benefits outweigh the risks. In general, alternative anesthetics are widely available and effective in patients with MHS.	PhenoToGuideline	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/volatile_anesthetic_succinylcholine/2018/30499100.pdf	Individuals who are designated as having Uncertain Susceptibility for RYR1 and Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility for CACNA1S should avoid using methoxyflurane. Methoxyflurane is a potent inhalation anesthetic associated with triggering malignant hyperthermia, a potentially life-threatening condition, particularly in individuals with these genetic susceptibilities. Alternative anesthetic agents that do not carry this risk should be considered to ensure patient safety.	human
What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Possible Decreased Function for SLCO1B1 with regards to taking atorvastatin? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	For individuals with Possible Decreased Function of the SLCO1B1 gene, there is an elevated risk of statin-associated side effects such as myopathy when taking atorvastatin. Clinical guidance often suggests starting with a lower dose or considering alternative statins that are less dependent on the SLCO1B1 transporter, such as pravastatin or rosuvastatin, to minimize these risks. Regular monitoring for muscle symptoms is also recommended.	PhenoToGuideline	https://files.cpicpgx.org/data/guideline/publication/statins/2022/publication.pdf	Prescribe ≤40mg as a starting dose and adjust doses of atorvastatin based on disease-specific guidelines. Prescriber should be aware of possible increased risk for myopathy especially for 40mg dose. If dose >40mg needed for desired efficacy, consider combination therapy (i.e., atorvastatin plus non-statin guideline directed medical therapy) (PMID: 30423391).	gpt-4o
