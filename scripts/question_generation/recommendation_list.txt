No adjustments needed from typical dosing strategies. Subsequent doses should be adjusted according to therapeutic drug monitoring, response and side effects. An HLA-B*15:02 negative test does not eliminate the risk of phenytoin-induced SJS/TEN and patients should be carefully monitored according to a usual standard.

Recommend alternative hormonal therapy such as an aromatase inhibitor for postmenopausal women or aromatase inhibitor along with ovarian function suppression in premenopausal women given that these approaches are superior to tamoxifen regardless of CYP2D6 genotype (PMID 26211827) and based on knowledge that CYP2D6 poor metabolizers switched from tamoxifen to anastrozole do not have an increased risk of recurrence (PMID 23213055). Note, higher dose tamoxifen (40 mg/day) increases but does not normalize endoxifen concentrations and can be considered if there are contraindications to aromatase inhibitor therapy (PMID 27226358, 21768473).

Reduce starting doses to 25% of normal dose and adjust doses of thioguanine based on degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. Allow 4-6 weeks to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment. In setting of myelosuppression, emphasis should be on reducing thioguanine over other agents.

The latency period for cutaneous adverse drug reactions is variable depending on phenotype; however, all usually occur within three months of regular dosing. Therefore, if the patient has previously used carbamazepine consistently for longer than three months without incidence of cutaneous adverse reactions, cautiously consider use of carbamazepine.
The latency period for drug-induced SJS/TEN is short with continuous dosing and adherence to therapy (~4-28 days), and cases usually occur within three months of dosing; therefore, if the patient has previously used carbamazepine consistently for longer than three months without incidence of cutaneous adverse reactions, cautiously consider use of carbamazepine in the future.
The latency period for drug-induced SJS/TEN is short with continuous dosing and adherence to therapy (~4-28 days), and cases usually occur within three months of dosing; therefore, if the patient has previously used oxcarbazepine consistently for longer than three months without incidence of cutaneous adverse reactions, cautiously consider use of oxcarbazepine in the future.
There is no need to avoid prescribing of atazanavir based on UGT1A1 genetic test result. Inform the patient that some patients stop atazanavir because of jaundice (yellow eyes and skin), but that this patient's genotype makes this unlikely (less than about a 1 in 20 chance of stopping atazanavir because of jaundice).
