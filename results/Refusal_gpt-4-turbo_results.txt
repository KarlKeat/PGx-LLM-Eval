What SNPs are in the allele definition for CYP2C19 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	True		The CYP2C19 enzyme, encoded by the CYP2C19 gene, is primarily involved in the metabolism of various drugs in the body. Genetic variations (polymorphisms) in the CYP2C19 gene affect the enzyme's activity, leading to differences in how individuals respond to medications.    For CYP2C19, the reference allele, typically denoted as CYP2C19*1, represents the wild-type allele that is associated with normal enzymatic activity. The definition of the CYP2C19*1 allele generally implies the absence of mutations commonly associated with altered enzymatic activity.    The most studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) commonly used to define variant alleles of CYP2C19 (such as CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3) include:    - **CYP2C19*2**: defined by the SNP rs4244285, which creates an aberrant splice site.  - **CYP2C19*3**: defined by the SNP rs4986893, which results in a premature stop codon.    For the reference allele (CYP2C19*1), typically, no specific variations directly define it; rather, it is characterized by the absence of the defining mutations of other alleles (like *2 or *3). If specific reference SNPs are needed for CYP2C19*1, they would not typically include variants that lead to decreased function but may include:  - rs12248560 (CYP2C19*17) - This SNP is sometimes used in the context of increased enzyme activity, although it formally defines a different allele associated with ultra-rapid metabolism.    Without known SNPs that negatively affect function (like in *2 or *3), the CYP2C19*1 allele is usually considered the default assumption of normal function in the absence of documented variants. Thus, any SNP defining the rapid or loss-of-function allele would be absent in CYP2C19*1.     Therefore, to directly answer your query, the CYP2C19 reference (normal function) allele, typically, lacks the SNPs that are associated with decreased or altered function. Hence for CYP2C19*1, no specific rsIDs beyond those conferring normal function are usually assigned or described, as it is primarily defined by the absence of the variants present in other alleles.	The CYP2C19 gene is an important gene in pharmacogenomics, encoding an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs in clinical use. The reference allele, often called *CYP2C19*1 or the wild-type allele, typically refers to the normal functioning version of the gene without the well-documented loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations.    Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can define this allele by their absence (i.e., having specific SNPs implies a variant form of CYP2C19, not the reference allele). Nevertheless, two commonly referenced SNPs that help identify CYP2C19*1 by their wild-type status are:    1. **rs4244285** - The G allele represents the wild-type allele which is part of defining the *CYP2C19*1 allele. The A allele at this position defines the *CYP2C19*2 allele, which is a loss-of-function allele.       2. **rs4986893** - The G allele signifies the wild-type allele, characteristic of *CYP2C19*1. The A allele here is indicative of the *CYP2C19*3 allele, another major loss-of-function variant.    Both of these SNPs are silent or synonymous changes (i.e., they do not change the amino acid sequence of the enzyme) but are critical in pharmacogenetic testing because they affect the enzyme's function through various molecular mechanisms, including splicing defects and altered mRNA stability.    To determine whether an individual carries the reference *CYP2C19* allele, genetic tests usually screen for the absence of major loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutations, including checking the genotype at these SNP positions among others to conclude that the gene likely functions normally.    If you are looking to determine the specific composition or haplotype structure strictly of *CYP2C19*1 (reference allele), it can depend on the absence of variant alleles at several other loci apart from these key ones, reflecting the entirety of the wild-type gene sequence.

What SNPs are in the allele definition for APOE *2/*2 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	True		The APOE *2 allele is defined by the presence of two specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the APOE gene. These SNPs are:    1. **rs429358** - For the APOE *2 allele, the presence of a Cytosine (C) at this position is common across *3 and *4 alleles, so it is not distinctive for the *2 allele.     2. **rs7412** - The APOE *2 allele is characterized by a Cytosine (C) at this SNP location, unlike the *3 and *4 alleles, which have Arginine (R) encoded here instead (change from C to T).    For the APOE *2/*2 genotype, an individual would have two copies of the rs7412 C allele (homozygous CC for rs7412), and most likely two copies of the rs429358 C allele (homozygous CC for rs429358). This configuration strongly suggests the APOE *2/*2 genotype.	The allele definition for APOE *2/*2 in the context of genotyping typically involves examining certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to the APOE gene located on chromosome 19. The APOE gene is significant because it codes for the apolipoprotein E, which is crucial for lipid transport and metabolic processes in the body. APOE has several isoforms, including APOE E2, E3, and E4, which are implicated in various health conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease.    For APOE *2/*2, the key SNPs defining this genotype are:  - **rs429358**: Typically, for APOE*2, this SNP should have a T allele.  - **rs7412**: For APOe*2, this SNP needs to have a T allele, which distinguishes APOE*2 from APOE*3 (which has an rs7412 C allele) and APOE*4 (which has an rs7412 C allele).    Thus, an individual with the genotype rs429358-TT and rs7412-TT on both chromosomal copies would be considered to have an APOE *2/*2 genotype. However, it is crucial to recognize that additional SNPs or regions might also be analyzed depending on the specific methodologies or additional refinements in allele definitions that research might present.    These SNPs are essential for distinguishing between the different APOE alleles, particularly in research and diagnostic contexts associated with disease risks linked to the APOE gene variants.

What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT2B7*2/*2 reference (rs7439366) ? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	True		The SNP defining the UGT2B7*2 allele is rs7439366. This allele of the UGT2B7 gene is characterized by a C to T change. The presence of the T allele in UGT2B7*2 affects the enzyme's activity, which is involved in the metabolism of various important drugs. Thus, the rs7439366 SNP, specifically with the presence of the T allele, is a key marker for the UGT2B7*2 allele.	The UGT2B7*2 allele is defined by the presence of the SNP rs7439366. This SNP involves a C to T change at nucleotide position 802. Consequently, the UGT2B7*2 allele can be identified through genotyping rs7439366.     UGT2B7 (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B7) is involved in the metabolism of various endogenous and exogenous compounds, and variations in this gene can affect drug metabolism. The rs7439366 SNP has been studied for its impact on the enzyme's activity and drug response variability in individuals.     So directly answering your question, the SNP defining UGT2B7*2 in terms of the rsID is **rs7439366**.	False	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for *2/*2 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	True		To provide an accurate response to your question on SNP identification within a specific allele, such as *2/*2, clarification is needed regarding the gene of interest. Allele nomenclature like *2/*2 is used in pharmacogenomics to describe specific variants of genes involved in drug metabolism, transport, or drug target pathways. However, the meaning of *2/*2 can differ depending on the gene in question (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP2C19, VKORC1, etc.).    Please specify the gene you are referring to, and I can provide more detailed and accurate information regarding the specific SNPs and their corresponding dbSNP IDs.	"To clarify the allele definition specifically for ""*2/*2"" in a pharmacogenomic context, more information about the gene in question is needed. Different genes have different allelic designations like *2/*2, and these designations refer to specific variations within that gene. Commonly studied genes in pharmacogenomics include CYP2D6, CYP2C19, VKORC1, among others.    For instance, in the case of the CYP2C19 gene, the *2 allele is defined primarily by a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) resulting in the loss of function of the enzyme. The defining SNP for CYP2C19*2 is rs4244285, where a G to A substitution results in a splicing defect.    In pharmacogenomic literature, ""*2/*2"" commonly refers to an individual carrying two copies of the loss-of-function allele (homozygous).    If you are referring to a specific gene or another context, please provide more details so I can give a more precise answer about the SNP(s) involved."	False	False

What SNPs are in the allele definition for CYP4F2 *1? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The CYP4F2 *1 allele, often referred to as the wild-type allele, does not contain any of the functionally significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that define other variant alleles of this gene. Therefore, unlike variant alleles such as CYP4F2 *2, *3, etc., which are defined based on specific SNPs, the *1 allele does not have unique SNPs and is primarily characterized by the absence of the SNPs that define these variants.    For reference in pharmacogenomics, the most notable SNP in other CYP4F2 alleles is rs1558139, which is associated with altered enzyme activity in CYP4F2 *3, but this SNP (and others like it) are specifically not present in the CYP4F2 *1 allele.	The CYP4F2 *1 allele is considered the reference or wild-type allele for the CYP4F2 gene. This means it is generally defined by the absence of function-altering single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are present in other variant alleles. Notably, the CYP4F2 gene has several SNPs that influence its function, one of the most studied being rs2108622, which is associated with vitamin K metabolism and warfarin dosing. However, this specific SNP is not part of the CYP4F2 *1 allele; rather, it defines the *3 allele.    For the *1 allele of CYP4F2, there are typically no defining SNPs because it represents the wild-type sequence. Therefore, the CYP4F2 *1 allele can be considered as having the ancestral or most common versions of SNPs across the gene locus, without any specific function-altering mutations that define other variant alleles. In practical terms, when a specific rsID is not mentioned for an allele like CYP4TP *1, it implies that this allele represents the reference sequence as deposited in reference databases like the human reference genome.     To sum up, the CYP4F2 *1 allele does not have specific SNPs defining it but is instead characterized by the absence of variants that define other alleles like the *2, *3, and others which contain various SNPs, including those with known dbSNP IDs.
