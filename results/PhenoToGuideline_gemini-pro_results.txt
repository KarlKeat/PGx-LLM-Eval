Alternative pain medications that do not require CYP2D6 metabolism should be considered.	0.5868241520820118	0.6712189997506207	0.6157128084482854	0.5751038312120678	0.7308856	0.70070213	0.6140154	0.5811182	0.72409415	0.7190798	0.62698156	0.63344085	0.73623323	0.7003821	0.6592577	0.58942974	0.6911918	0.7284867	0.61820257	0.6532417	1

For individuals who are ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 and intermediate metabolizers of CYP2C19, the clinical guidance for taking imipramine is to start with a lower dose and increase it gradually as tolerated to achieve the desired therapeutic effect, but not to exceed the recommended maximum dose. This is because CYP2D6 is responsible for metabolizing imipramine to its active metabolite, desipramine, and CYP2C19 is responsible for metabolizing imipramine to its inactive metabolite, 2-hydroxyimipramine. Therefore, individuals who are ultrarapid metabolizers of CYP2D6 may have higher levels of desipramine, which can lead to an increased risk of side effects, such as dizziness, dry mouth, and blurred vision.	0.7298910488198416	0.7450422613076159	0.7134930859317925	0.6256556396660394	0.66537225	0.64964586	0.5529227	0.59296894	0.6163607	0.65750116	0.5660723	0.5926769	0.49014905	0.56931394	0.53625494	0.5727762	0.55758446	0.6534099	0.5688579	0.5732996	0

This is because vitamin K is essential for the production of clotting factors, and G6PD deficiency can lead to a decrease in the production of these factors, increasing the risk of bleeding.	0.3424545180768646	0.3777663797910543	0.4139123206713564	0.4474273848716332	0.441855	0.43144685	0.4303917	0.61987466	0.40442526	0.38260683	0.35706958	0.6296266	0.3455688	0.30072802	0.2888585	0.5768171	0.42080605	0.3988476	0.46758947	0.6152924	0

No reason to avoid based on G6PD status	['Avoid vitamin k. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vitamin k with a reduced dose.', 'Take vitamin k with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vitamin k as normal. There is no recommendation.	Individuals who are normal for G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) do not have a deficiency in this enzyme and therefore do not require any special precautions or guidance regarding vitamin K intake.

No recommendation	['Avoid voriconazole. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take voriconazole with a reduced dose.', 'Take voriconazole with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking voriconazole as normal. There is no recommendation.	For patients who are Indeterminate metabolizers for CYP2C19, it is recommended to use the lower end of the dosing range for voriconazole and monitor closely for breakthrough infections or adverse effects. This is because Indeterminate metabolizers may have reduced metabolism of voriconazole, leading to higher drug concentrations and an increased risk of adverse effects.	0.21107742481640654	0.4455232856732073	0.21188961765860967	0.6025059652938197	0.13941139	0.3322561	0.17737858	0.6079364	0.09846951	0.2217329	0.11324045	0.6402447	-0.00805618	0.2889275	0.06293388	0.51607263	0.2972462	0.50118655	0.36249557	0.53529596	0

Choose an alternative agent that is not dependent on CYP2C19 metabolism as primary therapy in lieu of voriconazole. Such agents include liposomal amphotericin B and posaconazole.	['Proceed taking voriconazole as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take voriconazole with a reduced dose.', 'Take voriconazole with an increased dose.']	Avoid voriconazole. Take an alternate therapy.	For patients who are ultrarapid metabolizers (UMs) of CYP2C19, voriconazole dosing should be increased to achieve target serum concentrations, as UMs metabolize voriconazole more rapidly, leading to lower drug exposure. Therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to ensure adequate drug levels and minimize the risk of treatment failure.	0.6108024283098592	0.7363010412312784	0.571944090432645	0.6084648881203906	0.5411677	0.69853616	0.58659106	0.5515261	0.77850163	0.7335008	0.6654613	0.61282074	0.65418774	0.62062955	0.5397119	0.54367656	0.67979926	0.6731476	0.59010226	0.53297263	0

Initiate therapy with recommended standard of care dosing	['Avoid voriconazole. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take voriconazole with a reduced dose.', 'Take voriconazole with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking voriconazole as normal. There is no recommendation.	For patients who are intermediate metabolizers for CYP2C19, the recommended dose of voriconazole is 400 mg every 12 hours. This is because intermediate metabolizers have reduced activity of CYP2C19, which can lead to increased levels of voriconazole in the body. The higher dose is necessary to achieve therapeutic levels of voriconazole in these patients.	0.4285818991981889	0.4988635947310312	0.4739205566232929	0.5944146841668217	0.54427695	0.4721097	0.49840656	0.56860906	0.5070781	0.53591084	0.45065174	0.6765938	0.42229924	0.40004098	0.33257806	0.5332707	0.42872226	0.49174157	0.51202404	0.5105937	0

Choose an alternative agent that is not dependent on CYP2C19 metabolism as primary therapy in lieu of voriconazole. Such agents include isavuconazole, liposomal amphotericin B, and posaconazole. In the event that voriconazole is considered to be the most appropriate agent, based on clinical advice, for a patient with poor metabolizer genotype, voriconazole should be administered at a preferably lower than standard dosage with careful therapeutic drug monitoring.	['Proceed taking voriconazole as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take voriconazole with a reduced dose.', 'Take voriconazole with an increased dose.']	Avoid voriconazole. Take an alternate therapy.	CYP2C19 poor metabolizers may experience increased voriconazole exposure and are therefore recommended to have their dose reduced by 50%.
