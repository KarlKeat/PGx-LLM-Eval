MT-RNR1	m.961T>del+Cn	What SNPs are in the allele definition for MT-RNR1 m.961T>del+Cn? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs1556422499	The MT-RNR1 m.961T>del+Cn allele definition is a bit complex, but I'll break it down for you.    The m.961T>del+Cn allele is a mitochondrial DNA variant associated with hearing loss, particularly aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.    Here are the SNPs that make up the allele definition:    1. m.961T>C (rs2853498): This is a point mutation where a thymine (T) is replaced by a cytosine (C) at position 961 of the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA gene (MT-RNR1).  2. m.961del: This is a deletion of one or more nucleotides at position 961, which can occur in combination with the m.961T>C mutation.  3. +Cn: This notation indicates the presence of an insertion of one or more cytosine (C) nucleotides at position 961.    So, the dbSNP ID (rsID) associated with the m.961T>C mutation is rs2853498. However, please note that the deletion (m.961del) and insertion (+Cn) components do not have specific rsIDs, as they are not single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) but rather indels (insertions/deletions).    It's worth mentioning that the mitochondrial genome is not as well-represented in dbSNP as the nuclear genome, which is why you might not find rsIDs for all mitochondrial variants.

The rsID rs2853498 is a dbSNP ID that corresponds to the A663G variant in the MT-RNR1 gene. This variant is associated with hearing loss, particularly aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.    Note: Mitochondrial DNA variants do not have traditional autosomal chromosomes, so they do not have a typical chromosomal location. Instead, they are annotated using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) coordinate system. The MT-RNR1 gene is located on the mitochondrial genome.	['rs2853498']	0.0	0.0

It's essential to note that mitochondrial DNA variants do not have rsIDs in the classical sense, as they are not part of the nuclear genome. However, dbSNP has started to include mitochondrial DNA variants, and rs267606617 is the assigned ID for this particular variant.

The m.1555A>G mutation is the primary variant associated with aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity, and it's often found in cis with the m.1494C>T variant.    It's worth noting that these variants are located in the mitochondrial genome, so they don't have a traditional autosomal chromosome location. Instead, they're identified by their mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) coordinates.    References:    * Roberts et al. (2017). Mitochondrial DNA variants associated with aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.

However, the mtDNA variant m.951G>A is often associated with two SNPs in the mitochondrial genome: m.961G>A and m.965G>A. These SNPs are not assigned an rsID (dbSNP ID) since they are part of the mitochondrial genome.    According to the MITOMAP database, a comprehensive resource for human mitochondrial genome variations, the m.951G>A variant is part of a haplogroup-associated variant pattern. Specifically, it is associated with haplogroup J1c.
