Start with reduced starting doses (30%-80% of normal dose) if normal starting dose is 2-3 mg/kg/day (e.g., 0.6 – 2.4 mg/kg/day), and adjust doses of azathioprine based on degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines.

For individuals who are Possible Intermediate Metabolizers (IMs) for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) and Normal Metabolizers (NMs) for NUDT15, the recommended starting dose of azathioprine is typically reduced by 30-50% compared to the standard dose. This is because IMs for TPMT may have reduced enzyme activity, leading to increased levels of azathioprine and its active metabolites, which can increase the risk of side effects, including myelosuppression. Concomitant NM status for NUDT15 suggests a lower risk of severe myelosuppression, but caution is still warranted due to the potential for TPMT IM status to impact azathioprine metabolism. Regular monitoring of blood counts is recommended to assess for potential adverse effects.	0.052448016	0.03814197	0.04806524	-0.14099258	0.34783605	0.058294516	tensor(-0.1310)	tensor(0.3164)	tensor(0.0550)	0.7141320519098937	0.610098904864826	0.6123440158921024	0.7032185	0.5104487	0.5043845	0.63597244	0.448969	0.6522019	0.608727	0.5552819	0.5775165	0.6875729	0.58073705	0.5391916	1

Initiate therapy with recommended standard of care dosing	['Avoid voriconazole. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take voriconazole with a reduced dose.', 'Take voriconazole with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking voriconazole as normal. There is no recommendation.	Voriconazole is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19. Individuals with an Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) genotype may have reduced metabolism of voriconazole, leading to higher drug levels. Therefore, it is recommended to reduce the starting dose of voriconazole by 50% and monitor drug levels closely to ensure therapeutic efficacy and minimize the risk of adverse effects.	-0.10950473	0.03547183	-0.038702708	-0.0054190513	0.25226867	0.11293589	tensor(0.0173)	tensor(0.3895)	tensor(0.1723)	0.39564012039015484	0.5844184399457498	0.48443074311508266	0.38985488	0.54966974	0.51388985	0.40781492	0.63945127	0.4568128	0.259014	0.47159916	0.3514512	0.38955796	0.54168004	0.558936	0
