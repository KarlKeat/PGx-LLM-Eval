UGT1A1	*80+*28	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*28? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs3064744	The allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*28 includes the following SNPs:    1. UGT1A1 *28: rs8175347 (G>T) - this variant is associated with reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity and is commonly found in individuals with Gilbert syndrome.  2. UGT1A1 *80: rs887829 (T>C) - this variant has also been associated with altered UGT1A1 enzyme activity.    Both of these variants can impact the activity of the UGT1A1 enzyme, which plays a key role in the metabolism of bilirubin, drugs, and other compounds.	['rs887829', 'rs8175347']	0.5	0.5
UGT1A1	*6	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *6? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs4148323	The UGT1A1 *6 allele is associated with a SNP called rs4148323. This SNP results in a TA repeat in the TATAA element of the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. This variation leads to reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity and is associated with Gilbert syndrome, which is characterized by mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.	['rs4148323']	1.0	1.0
UGT1A1	*37	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs3064744	UGT1A1*37 is defined by the presence of two SNPs. One SNP is rs4148323 and the other is rs4148324. These SNPs create a T deletion in the TATA box regulatory region of the UGT1A1 promoter. This genetic variant is associated with reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity and is linked to Gilbert syndrome, a mild form of hyperbilirubinemia.	['rs4148324', 'rs4148323']	0.0	0.0
UGT1A1	*1	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *1? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs4148323;rs887829;rs3064744;rs35350960	The UGT1A1*1 allele refers to the wild-type allele of the UGT1A1 gene. It is associated with normal enzyme activity. The specific SNP within the UGT1A1*1 allele that is most commonly referenced is rs8175347, which is also known as UGT1A1*28. This SNP results in a TA-repeat sequence (TA)7TAA in the TATAA-box of the UGT1A1 gene promoter. The presence of this variant is associated with reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity and increased risk of conditions such as Gilbert syndrome and adverse effects to medications metabolized by UGT1A1, such as irinotecan.

UGT1A1	*80+*37	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs3064744	The UGT1A1*80+*37 allele refers to insertional inactivation of the UGT1A1 gene (UDP glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1) and is associated with reduced enzyme activity. The specific SNPs involved in this allele are typically not designated by rsIDs in the scientific literature. Instead, the nomenclature system used for UGT1A1 alleles conveys the genetic variation. In this case, UGT1A1*80+*37 refers to the combination of various genetic changes that result in reduced UGT1A1 enzyme activity. It is important to consult databases, such as PharmGKB or ClinVar, for more detailed information on specific variants associated with this allele.	[]	0.0	0.0
VKORC1	rs9923231 variant (T)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 variant (T)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	The allele definition for the VKORC1 rs9923231 variant (T) involves the presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene. The dbSNP ID for rs9923231 is rs9934438. This variant is associated with warfarin sensitivity and affects the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) gene, which plays a role in vitamin K metabolism and, therefore, in the response to warfarin therapy.
