Therefore, it is important to confirm the G6PD status prior to administering sulfadiazine.	0.122123286	0.25033545	0.18554045	tensor(-0.0240)	tensor(0.3345)	tensor(0.1330)	0.625954904775093	0.5523255495809093	0.35603036417371176	0.4818185	0.6724301	0.28779253	0.600596	0.6745027	0.2740071	0.5886906	0.57841206	0.25587213	0.46252474	0.5597671	0.43425107	0

This is because Indeterminate CYP2C19 status indicates that the patient has one functional CYP2C19 allele and one non-functional allele, resulting in intermediate enzyme activity. As voriconazole is primarily metabolized by CYP2C19, reduced dosing is recommended to avoid potential accumulation and toxicity.	-0.2831255	0.009703334	-0.15459925	tensor(-0.0439)	tensor(0.5473)	tensor(0.1907)	0.2210649054557517	0.6200227367151615	0.2587279427414255	0.13794437	0.573272	0.21783486	0.0687797	0.66145766	0.11914129	-0.11151882	0.48088542	0.08720999	0.2897634	0.5684956	0.44794685	0

Choose an alternative agent that is not dependent on CYP2C19 metabolism as primary therapy in lieu of voriconazole. Such agents include isavuconazole, liposomal amphotericin B, and posaconazole. In the event that voriconazole is considered to be the most appropriate agent, based on clinical advice, for a patient with poor metabolizer genotype, voriconazole should be administered at a preferably lower than standard dosage with careful therapeutic drug monitoring.
