Unlike its variant alleles (such as CYP3A5*3), CYP3A5*1 is characterized by the absence of the specific SNPs that define those variants. In other words, the *1 allele does not carry the mutations that are present in the non-functional or less functional variants.    For example, the CYP3A5*3 allele is defined by a specific SNP, rs776746, which is a G to A change in intron 3. The presence of this SNP leads to aberrant splicing and lower expression of the CYP3A5 enzyme. Therefore, the CYP3A5*1 allele is identified by the absence of the rs776746 SNP.    Since the CYP3A5*1 allele represents the reference sequence without these specific variations, there aren't specific SNPs that uniquely define it. Instead, it is defined by the absence of the SNPs that characterize its variant alleles.    To put it succinctly:  - **dbSNP ID (rsID) for *1:** The *1 (wild-type) allele is defined by the absence of variant-defining SNPs like rs776746.  	['rs776746']	1.0	0.2

Variants in the DPYD gene have been associated with altered enzyme activity, which can impact drug metabolism and toxicity.    The DPYD reference allele generally refers to the wild-type or “normal” enzyme activity variant, which is typically used as the baseline for comparison. While the reference allele itself does not have specific SNPs because it represents the normal gene sequence, I can provide information on some of the key SNPs associated with known DPYD variants that affect enzyme function:    1. **DPYD*2A / rs3918290**: This variant involves a splice site mutation (IVS14+1G>A).  2. **DPYD*13 / rs55886062**: This variant involves a missense mutation (c.1679T>G, resulting in p.Ile560Ser).  3. **rs67376798**: Another missense mutation (c.2846A>T, resulting in p.D949V).  4. **rs2297595**: This variant affects the 3' untranslated region of DPYD (c.1236G>A/HapB3).    These SNPs are examples of known DPYD gene variants that can result in reduced or absent enzyme activity, leading to increased risk of toxicity when treated with fluoropyrimidine drugs. The reference DPYD allele, by contrast, would not carry these mutations and would therefore be indicative of normal enzyme activity.    For a patient or clinical setting, it is crucial to genotype these specific SNPs to understand the likely activity of the DPYD enzyme and adjust fluoropyrimidine dosing accordingly.

Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs267606619	The MT-RNR1 gene encodes the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA, and the specific variant m.1494C>T is a point mutation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This mutation is not typically assigned the same kind of dbSNP rsID as nuclear DNA variants because it is located in the mitochondrial genome. However, in some cases, mitochondrial variations can have unique identifiers in mitochondrial databases such as MITOMAP or may sometimes appear in dbSNP.    For the MT-RNR1 m.1494C>T variant, you may not find a dbSNP ID (rsID) for this mitochondrial variant in the typical nuclear dbSNP repository. Instead, it might be documented in specialized mitochondrial databases. In MITOMAP, for instance, this variant is recorded with available literature supporting its identification and potential associations with conditions like aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.    To summarize:  - The SNP for MT-RNR1 m.1494C>T is not typically cataloged with an rsID.  - It can be found and reported in mitochondrial-specific databases like MITOMAP.    For detailed variant information and associated data, consulting MITOMAP or similar resources would be more fruitful than looking for an rsID.	[]	0.0	0.0

However, mitochondrial variants are typically cataloged differently from nuclear DNA variants and don't always have dbSNP IDs (rsIDs). For mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants, they are usually referred to by their position and nucleotide change, such as m.951G>A.    Currently, there is no specific dbSNP ID (rsID) for the m.951G>A variant in the MT-RNR1 gene. Mitochondrial variants often do not have rsIDs due to their distinct inheritance patterns and differing methods of variant cataloging compared to nuclear DNA.    To summarize:  - Variant: m.951G>A  - Gene: MT-RNR1 (Mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA)  - dbSNP ID: Not available    For the most accurate and updated information, you would typically consult mitochondrial databases like MITOMAP or relevant literature on mtDNA variants.

Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) VKORC1 rs9923231 is a specific site where genetic variation can be observed. For the reference (common) allele for rs9923231, which is cytosine (C), the allele definition is typically just this single SNP location. It's important to note that this SNP is used as a representative marker for genetic variations in the VKORC1 promoter region that can affect the activity of the protein it encodes.    Here is the specific information about this SNP:    - **SNP ID (rsID): rs9923231**  - **Reference Allele: C**    This SNP alone generally does not have sub-alleles defined by additional SNPs in typical descriptions. Additional SNPs in the VKORC1 gene may be involved in pharmacogenomics, but rs9923231 itself is usually evaluated independently in the context of its impact on warfarin dosing and other clinical considerations.    For more comprehensive understanding and haplotype associations, a larger sequencing or haplotype analysis might be necessary to examine other variations and their linkage with rs9923231. However, in terms of allele definition for rs9923231 (C) on its own, no additional SNPs are included in this specific definition.	['rs9923231']	1.0	1.0
