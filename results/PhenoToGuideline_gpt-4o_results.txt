Consulting with a clinical pharmacogenetics expert may also be beneficial for personalized dosing strategies.	-0.05273905	0.18115093	0.05591985	-0.14594306	0.3294265	0.046890184	-0.16254517436027527	0.44106513261795044	0.06761805713176727	0.7162499610338258	0.6035352359521438	0.6265667679543702	0.6497611	0.5953397	0.5677116	0.65353	0.682689	0.6799191	0.54467887	0.5654971	0.5756864	0.57820326	0.5274418	0.53868574	0

Alternative pain management strategies that do not rely on CYP2D6 metabolism should be considered.	-0.055753317	0.19026543	0.05771371	-0.16580589	0.32543302	0.03118282	-0.23162291944026947	0.25561946630477905	-0.0387406200170517	0.5716244892970503	0.557581105999568	0.5383949023438463	0.6720615	0.52918226	0.59314495	0.679039	0.5546107	0.59863967	0.6680064	0.5864855	0.5602084	0.6300134	0.624655	0.6168194	1
codeine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Normal Metabolizer and activity score = 1.25 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking codeine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Use codeine label recommended age- or weight-specific dosing.	['Avoid codeine.

For someone who is a normal metabolizer with an activity score of 1.25 for CYP2D6, standard dosing of codeine is typically appropriate. Codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6 to its active form, morphine, and normal metabolizers have a predictable and effective response with minimized risk for adverse effects or therapeutic failure. However, as there can be variations even within normal metabolizers, clinical monitoring is advised to ensure appropriate therapeutic outcomes.	-0.15171792	0.18116401	-0.0068081026	-0.2188642	0.0165812	-0.11100901	-0.20711731910705566	0.35720837116241455	0.004995804280042648	0.5343400108861125	0.5575604518166202	0.5592257275255968	0.6112968	0.47798422	0.44282997	0.61198854	0.6234113	0.5495834	0.6032652	0.557412	0.5305482	0.5391508	0.6058459	0.52305245	1

Alternatively, clinicians might consider selecting a different antidepressant that is less dependent on CYP2D6 metabolism.	-0.016549738	0.17003505	0.07286372	-0.17024349	0.34407705	0.03358062	-0.18242491781711578	0.44165802001953125	0.05219016969203949	0.7228186794718886	0.6368742799356727	0.6845076083074014	0.699021	0.57140964	0.5544959	0.5924798	0.58896106	0.5521403	0.55242395	0.5826029	0.56645215	0.6186746	0.64638674	0.6530085	1
doxorubicin	G6PD	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Deficient for G6PD with regards to taking doxorubicin? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.

If citalopram or escitalopram are clinically appropriate, and adequate efficacy is not achieved at standard maintenance dosing, consider titrating to a higher maintenance dose.	['Proceed taking escitalopram as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take escitalopram with a reduced dose.', 'Take escitalopram with an increased dose.']	Avoid escitalopram. Take an alternate therapy.	For individuals who are identified as Ultrarapid Metabolizers (UMs) for CYP2C19, escitalopram may be metabolized more quickly, potentially leading to lower plasma levels and reduced therapeutic efficacy. Clinical guidance typically recommends considering an alternative antidepressant that is not primarily metabolized by CYP2C19 or closely monitoring the patient's response and adjusting the dosage as needed. If efficacy is suboptimal, increasing the dose may be required, but only under careful supervision.	0.14172873	0.31613043	0.22617416	-0.15963857	0.37886885	0.05190713	-0.16073837876319885	0.4730152487754822	0.07788533717393875	0.7683000125192724	0.6507244380603942	0.6428957832645799	0.7226497	0.5849762	0.52745914	0.7787532	0.61648154	0.58093095	0.8257954	0.6448572	0.5820264	0.7862726	0.654774	0.6489826	1

Patients with Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, particularly those with Chronic Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia (CNSHA), are at an increased risk of hemolysis when exposed to certain medications, including ofloxacin. Clinical guidance typically advises against the use of ofloxacin in these individuals to prevent hemolytic episodes.

For individuals with uncertain risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss due to MT-RNR1 genetic variants, clinical guidance generally advises caution with aminoglycoside antibiotics like plazomicin. These individuals should consider alternative antibiotics when possible because specific MT-RNR1 variants (e.g., A1555G) are associated with a higher risk of ototoxicity, which could result in permanent hearing loss upon exposure to aminoglycosides. Genetic testing to determine the presence of these variants can provide clearer risk stratification and inform safer antibiotic choices.	-0.0477307	0.18813953	0.061754204	-0.26825753	0.021233601	-0.1411009	-0.20771849155426025	0.30792632699012756	-0.00526188500225544	0.5210914465377275	0.5359335929258686	0.5491781285785802	0.5325333	0.4937983	0.5228478	0.6373014	0.4420432	0.44192627	0.6986511	0.43076724	0.4378074	0.54709655	0.43171048	0.51445043	0

Routine monitoring and adherence to the prescribed dosage are advised to ensure safety and efficacy.	-0.22057717	0.059116896	-0.09612932	-0.19346476	0.031703416	-0.08934321	-0.19113785028457642	0.318647176027298	0.005684295669198036	0.6219453268657603	0.6390011783765458	0.5835141231257409	0.54484916	0.6628379	0.565359	0.41946006	0.7552942	0.69230556	0.45979062	0.5475123	0.5949706	0.5639204	0.5624585	0.5843219	1

Start with reduced doses (50% to 80% of normal dose) if normal starting dose is ≥ 40-60 mg/m2/day (e.g., 20-48 mg/m2/day) and adjust doses of thioguanine based on degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. Allow 2-4 weeks to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment. If myelosuppression occurs, and depending on other therapy, emphasis should be on reducing thioguanine over other agents (PMID 20354201, 11037857).	['Proceed taking thioguanine as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Avoid thioguanine. Take an alternate therapy.']	Take thioguanine with an altered dose.	For individuals who are intermediate metabolizers of TPMT and possible intermediate metabolizers of NUDT15, there is an elevated risk of thioguanine toxicity due to reduced drug metabolism. Clinical guidelines recommend considering a significant dose reduction of thioguanine and thorough monitoring for adverse effects such as myelosuppression. Regular follow-up with complete blood counts is crucial to manage and adjust the therapy accordingly.	0.19536193	0.055024292	0.124627545	-0.03163445	0.45937496	0.17021081	-0.03349084034562111	0.32393884658813477	0.12243229150772095	0.7257337351623825	0.6632659324470564	0.6657849077815917	0.57836306	0.531518	0.5670193	0.6233791	0.4821703	0.5876406	0.55332017	0.5193909	0.5934294	0.6019123	0.69956696	0.687003	0
tobramycin	MT-RNR1	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is increased risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss for MT-RNR1 with regards to taking tobramycin?
