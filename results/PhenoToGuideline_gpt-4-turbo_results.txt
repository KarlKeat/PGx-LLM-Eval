For an individual identified as a Normal Metabolizer on the CYP2C9 (activity score = 2.0) and with Decreased Function for SLCO1B1, clinical guidance for taking fluvastatin involves standard dosing strategies, as normal CYP2C9 activity typically does not necessitate alterations to standard fluvastatin dosing. However, the decreased function of SLCO1B1, a transporter gene, may increase plasma levels of fluvastatin, leading to an elevated risk of side effects such as myopathy. Therefore, it might be advisable to monitor the patient for muscle-related symptoms and consider initiating fluvastatin at a lower dose, with careful monitoring for efficacy and toxicity.	0.6973309439625582	0.6367757620343362	0.6899546755355092	0.6274601306544714	0.55590045	0.50806934	0.53615195	0.58963037	0.59662426	0.6572926	0.4876262	0.61940706	0.6035015	0.52920747	0.515023	0.49649686	0.64172053	0.5800475	0.60205317	0.59923	0

For individuals identified as intermediate metabolizers of CYP2D365 with an activity score of 0.5, it is important to recognize that they might have reduced enzymatic activity compared to extensive metabolizers. Since fluvoxamine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, individuals with this phenotype might have slower clearance and a higher risk of side effects at conventional doses. Clinicians should consider starting treatment at a lower dose, closely monitor for adverse effects, and adjust the dosage accordingly to optimize therapeutic outcomes and minimize potential toxicity.	0.3927908628591188	0.4769947583084961	0.49449161103990885	0.5603512137062715	0.24427208	0.39972264	0.4494815	0.4001044	0.32110852	0.5182947	0.4310929	0.57678914	0.31717327	0.48154306	0.4874611	0.41113847	0.46317452	0.51965314	0.5779416	0.58046705	0

For an individual identified as an ultrarapid metabolizer with an activity score of 4.0 for CYP2D6, the use of fluvoxamine may require careful consideration. Although fluvoxamine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, it also acts as a strong inhibitor of this enzyme. Therefore, even ultrarapid metabolizers may not require a significant adjustment in dosage since fluvoxamine itself can inhibit its own metabolism, potentially leading to higher plasma concentrations. Nevertheless, monitoring for side effects or signs of increased drug exposure is recommended to adjust the dose appropriately.	0.23328379532142723	0.4218766925953058	0.2753222920876771	0.5897635789470859	0.24617687	0.36573133	0.21147163	0.5468143	0.2173285	0.32147405	0.16616675	0.60949844	0.05005299	0.26190105	0.08319646	0.46309718	0.24021176	0.53878886	0.36661777	0.54448056	0

Fluvoxamine is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2, and to a lesser degree by CYP2D6. For an individual with an ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6, the impact on fluvoxamine metabolism is likely minimal since CYP2D6 is not the primary metabolic pathway. Therefore, the ultrarapid metabolism status of CYP2D6 would typically not require an adjustment in fluvoxamine dosing, but clinical monitoring for efficacy and side effects is always recommended.	0.23065934710859257	0.4218766925953058	0.2753222920876771	0.5577717922937542	0.12577082	0.36573133	0.21147163	0.47187182	0.14093092	0.32147405	0.16616675	0.56395245	-0.0029067397	0.26190105	0.08319646	0.40844253	0.20404878	0.53878886	0.36661777	0.612309	0

For an individual identified as an ultrarapid metabolizer of CYP2D6 (activity score ≥6.0), the use of ondansetron could be less effective due to an increased rate of metabolism which leads to lower plasma concentrations of the drug. Ondansetron, a medication used to prevent nausea and vomiting, does not undergo significant metabolism by CYP2D6, but evidence suggests that genetic variations affecting other metabolic pathways may impact its effectiveness. Therefore, while specific adjustments for ondansetron based on CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer status are generally not necessary, it would be prudent to monitor the patient for efficacy and consider alternative antiemetic treatments if ondansetron is not adequately controlling symptoms.	0.5519527661789997	0.6064120937930781	0.4734419763492406	0.6137683116030702	0.6562805	0.5319944	0.47772932	0.58038855	0.6724035	0.41769275	0.39910686	0.5461536	0.70058286	0.5270997	0.5287408	0.6008073	0.5116599	0.5799418	0.52722955	0.49055746	0

For individuals identified as ultrarapid metabolizers with a CYP2D6 activity score of 2.75, clinical guidance on the use of ondansetron may differ compared to those with typical CYP2D6 activity. Ondansetron is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, and ultrarapid metabolizers might break down this drug faster than normal. As a result, this could potentially lead to reduced efficacy of ondansetron due to lower plasma concentrations; hence, alternative antiemetic therapy should be considered, or adjustment of ondansetron dose might be necessary under close clinical supervision.	0.5214101518763833	0.6064120937930781	0.4734419763492406	0.6281436866902628	0.51916784	0.5319944	0.47772932	0.48506337	0.7011902	0.41769275	0.39910686	0.6010894	0.68805075	0.5270997	0.5287408	0.64472806	0.57323474	0.5799418	0.52722955	0.5852516	0

Sertraline metabolism is primarily influenced by the enzyme CYP2B6, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. In the case of an individual who is an ultrarapid metabolizer for CYP2B6, the metabolism of sertraline could be significantly enhanced, potentially leading to reduced plasma levels of the drug and possibly decreased efficacy. Therefore, clinical guidance may involve adjusting the dose of sertraline upwards, or considering alternative medications not metabolized by CYP2B6, while monitoring the patient carefully for therapeutic effectiveness and side effects. The absent result for CYP2C19 may have less impact, but should be clarified to ensure comprehensive understanding of the individual's metabolic profile.	0.3073288903439048	0.4630028899358478	0.49691091383335034	0.5439497384015732	0.2725225	0.38907063	0.42368975	0.49028078	0.31614536	0.48815998	0.40268913	0.6170435	0.29067928	0.44016293	0.4359481	0.48499638	0.22434741	0.51360846	0.58839625	0.46288425	0

Consequently, normal metabolizers may require higher doses of tacrolimus to achieve therapeutic concentrations compared to patients with lower or no CYP3A5 activity (non-expressers). Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring is highly recommended to adjust dosing and ensure effective immunosuppression while avoiding toxicity.	0.3905221705462567	0.4616834447000675	0.4362495880492575	0.5907122754205577	0.35389888	0.5866446	0.4795239	0.4981517	0.36370686	0.49911952	0.47183117	0.48121923	0.4035179	0.5063754	0.40307587	0.48741412	0.46341276	0.48400515	0.31489778	0.644156	1

thioguanine	TPMT;NUDT15	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer for TPMT and Possible Intermediate Metabolizer for NUDT15 with regards to taking thioguanine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Start with reduced doses (50% to 80% of normal dose) if normal starting dose is ≥ 40-60 mg/m2/day (e.g., 20-48 mg/m2/day) and adjust doses of thioguanine based on degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. Allow 2-4 weeks to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment. If myelosuppression occurs, and depending on other therapy, emphasis should be on reducing thioguanine over other agents (PMID 20354201, 11037857).	['Proceed taking thioguanine as normal.
