Based on CACNA1S status, halogenated volatile anesthetics or the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine are relatively contraindicated in persons with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS). They should not be used, except in extraordinary circumstances where the benefits outweigh the risks. In general, alternative anesthetics are widely available and effective in patients with MHS.	['Proceed taking succinylcholine as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take succinylcholine with a reduced dose.', 'Take succinylcholine with an increased dose.']	Avoid succinylcholine. Take an alternate therapy.	Individuals who are classified as No Result for RYR1 and Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility for CACNA1S may still have a genetic predisposition to malignant hyperthermia (MH). Therefore, it is recommended to avoid succinylcholine, a medication known to trigger MH in susceptible individuals, and opt for alternative agents when possible to reduce the risk of MH crisis during anesthesia. Close monitoring by healthcare providers experienced in managing MH is also recommended if succinylcholine must be used in emergency situations.	0.14665757	0.20844555	0.18008505	-0.17739627	0.4334311	0.05389333	-0.24771276116371155	0.2985513210296631	-0.038576237857341766	0.7757456893950666	0.5504745037549911	0.5528084689222236	0.8070484	0.5095578	0.5715323	0.85836565	0.45558143	0.4291223	0.84305036	0.5188828	0.4766003	0.76509327	0.5996142	0.55594534	1

Start with reduced doses (50% to 80% of normal dose) if normal starting dose is ≥ 40-60 mg/m2/day (e.g., 20-48 mg/m2/day) and adjust doses of thioguanine based on degree of myelosuppression and disease-specific guidelines. Allow 2-4 weeks to reach steady-state after each dose adjustment. If myelosuppression occurs, and depending on other therapy, emphasis should be on reducing thioguanine over other agents (PMID 20354201, 11037857).	['Proceed taking thioguanine as normal.

For someone who is a Possible Intermediate Metabolizer for TPMT and a Normal Metabolizer for NUDT15, there is an increased risk of thiopurine-related toxicity when taking thioguanine. Close monitoring for adverse effects such as myelosuppression is recommended, and dose adjustments may be necessary to minimize the risk of toxicity while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. Healthcare providers should consider alternative medications or adjust the dosage of thioguanine based on the individual's genotype and clinical response.	0.15016629	0.05748748	0.10562066	-0.11863251	0.3995682	0.088614844	-0.09436749666929245	0.36406591534614563	0.09483080357313156	0.7333451009999289	0.6868109252181837	0.6936636632693968	0.50299746	0.52974015	0.5580592	0.6257478	0.5326211	0.66531956	0.5851879	0.59217864	0.66705084	0.68021655	0.68339086	0.6342563	0

Consulting with a healthcare provider and a pharmacogenomics expert can guide personalized treatment decisions.	0.10159184	0.23498243	0.16803202	-0.1501421	0.25474262	0.019676456	-0.15541905164718628	0.3315299451351166	0.0406668446958065	0.7489218593834762	0.5866719435684131	0.6479391354224616	0.643235	0.47056267	0.4524748	0.7135689	0.5885251	0.58223903	0.6990808	0.508204	0.49728626	0.63816094	0.6104376	0.6332325	0
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer and activity score = 1.0 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.	For someone who is an Intermediate Metabolizer with an activity score of 1.0 for CYP2D6, caution should be exercised when prescribing vortioxetine. Monitoring for potential adverse effects or reduced efficacy of vortioxetine may be necessary. Dose adjustments or alternative treatment options may be considered based on individual response and tolerability.	-0.08475604	0.1743066	0.033581726	-0.09023312	0.07934357	-0.008160505	-0.03871807083487511	0.4771350026130676	0.16005893051624298	0.4308521087595362	0.6145954543760498	0.6962840336854362	0.47880992	0.57425535	0.5687793	0.439827	0.6535175	0.59377825	0.43546674	0.5851056	0.5523073	0.4892179	0.62724936	0.6581075	0
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer and activity score = 0.5 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.	As an Intermediate Metabolizer with a CYP2D6 activity score of 0.5, there is a potential for reduced metabolism of vortioxetine, which is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. This could lead to increased drug levels and potentially an increased risk of side effects. Close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects is recommended, and dose adjustments may be necessary based on individual response and tolerability. Consulting with a healthcare provider specializing in pharmacogenomics can provide personalized recommendations for optimizing treatment with vortioxetine.	-0.13665202	0.18801191	0.0055889245	-0.16286314	0.0936878	-0.0463037	-0.13710810244083405	0.43078339099884033	0.08141886442899704	0.4178333076206759	0.5853612811397394	0.6802733253816675	0.33205357	0.5664456	0.5754812	0.32666823	0.64883953	0.67190075	0.37966114	0.60370433	0.6191407	0.48121607	0.6157138	0.69021505	0
