For DPYD, several SNPs are well-characterized, but the wild-type or reference sequence does not contain these variants. Therefore, specific SNPs are not associated with the reference allele (DPYD*1) because it is defined as the non-mutated or non-variant form of the gene.    Here are some common variant alleles for DPYD and their associated SNPs:    - DPYD*2A: c.1905+1G>A (rs3918290)  - DPYD*13: c.1679T>G (rs55886062)  - DPYD*9A: c.85T>C (rs1801265)    However, it is important to clarify that these SNPs are not in the reference allele (DPYD*1); rather, they are used to define variant alleles.     For the wild-type allele (DPYD*1), there are no specific SNPs to report since it is defined by the absence of these and other known functional variants.    If you are looking for specific SNPs within the coding region of the DPYD gene that are often assessed for other purposes (such as molecular studies or variant annotations), more detailed sequencing data or a specific database query might be required. But generally, the concept of the reference allele is that it contains no disruptive or known functional SNPs."	['rs3918290', 'rs55886062', 'rs1801265']	1.0	0.03614457831325301

UGT1A1	*80+*28	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*28? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs3064744	The UGT1A1 *80+*28 allele involves at least two specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):    1. UGT1A1*80 is characterized by the SNP rs887829.  2. UGT1A1*28 is characterized by a variation in the TA repeats in the promoter region, often described as a (TA)7 repeat upstream of the gene. This does not have a specific rsID, as it is a repeat variation rather than a single nucleotide polymorphism.    Therefore, the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*28 encompasses both rs887829 and the (TA)7 repeat in the UGT1A1 promoter.	['rs887829']	1.0	0.5
UGT1A1	*6	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *6?

UGT1A1	*37	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs3064744	The UGT1A1*37 allele is characterized by polymorphisms in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene. Specifically, it involves a variant in the number of TA repeats in the TATA box of the promoter region. The *37 allele consists of nine TA repeats (A(TA)9TAA).     The dbSNP ID for the polymorphism involving the variable number of TA repeats is rs8175347.     Therefore, UGT1A1*37 is associated with the insertion rs8175347 in the promoter region of the UGT1A1 gene.	['rs8175347']	0.0	0.0
UGT1A1	*1	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *1? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs35350960;rs4148323;rs3064744	The UGT1A1*1 allele is considered the wild-type or reference allele for the UGT1A1 gene. It is defined as the version of the gene with no variant that significantly affects enzyme function when considering the most common and studied SNPs. Because it is the reference allele, it is not typically characterized by specific SNPs but rather by the absence of variants that define other alleles, such as UGT1A1*28 (which involves a TA repeat expansion in the promoter region).    Therefore, UGT1A1*1 does not have unique SNPs associated with it as defining characteristics. Instead, it represents the default or baseline sequence.    If you have questions about specific variants or alleles like UGT1A1*28 or others, I can provide more targeted information.    	[]	0.0	0.0
UGT1A1	*80+*37	What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs887829;rs3064744	The UGT1A1 *80+*37 haplotype includes multiple specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The most commonly recognized SNPs in this combined haplotype are:    1. rs4148323 (c.211G>A, leading to p.Gly71Arg)  2. rs8175347 (TA repeat polymorphism in the promoter region, also known as the UGT1A1*28)    Unfortunately, there is no single database entry or allele name directly representing the *80+*37 combination with a specific set of SNPs beyond these known variations often associated with UGT1A1 metabolism variability.    When referring to combined haplotypes like *80+*37 specifically, you generally need to refer to detailed pharmacogenetic resources or literature in the field, as this may involve multiple overlapping variations often cataloged together in specialized studies.    For definitive information, checking a pharmacogenetic database or clinical annotated guidelines such as PharmGKB or CPIC could provide the most accurate details specific to this allele combination.    Additional variations and intricate haplotype associations often require expert interpretation, particularly when assessing clinical relevance.	['rs4148323', 'rs8175347']	0.0	0.0
VKORC1	rs9923231 variant (T)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 variant (T)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	The rs9923231 variant in the VKORC1 gene is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The SNP occurs in the promoter region of the VKORC1 gene, leading to the presence of either a guanine (G) or thymine (T) at this position. Specifically, the VKORC1 rs9923231 variant involves a change from G to T. Here are the details:    - dbSNP ID: rs9923231  - Alleles: G > T    This particular variant is associated with reduced expression of the VKORC1 gene and increased sensitivity to warfarin, an anticoagulant medication. There are no other SNPs within the definition of this specific rsID; it represents a single nucleotide change.	['rs9923231']	1.0	1.0
VKORC1	rs9923231 reference (C)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	"The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) VKORC1 rs9923231 reference (C) is located within the VKORC1 gene. The ""C"" allele at this position is the reference allele, while the ""T"" allele typically indicates a variant. This SNP affects vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1), which is involved in the pharmacodynamics of warfarin, an anticoagulant medication.    For this specific SNP:    - Reference allele: C (cytosine)  - Variant allele: T (thymine)    The dbSNP ID for this SNP is rs9923231.    There is only one SNP involved in this specific allele definition. Therefore, no additional dbSNP IDs are involved in this particular allele definition apart from rs9923231 itself.    If more SNPs were involved in a particular haplotype or allele definition, their respective dbSNP IDs would also be listed, but for rs9923231, it stands alone in this context.
