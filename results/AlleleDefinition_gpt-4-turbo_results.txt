In defining the CYP3A5 *1 allele, the key single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to consider is rs776746. This SNP is also commonly known as 6986A>G or CYP3A5*3.     In the context of the CYP3A5*1 allele, the rs776746 SNP results in the A allele (or wild type), which does not contain the splice variant associated with the *3 allele (the G allele). Individuals who are homozygous for the A allele (AA) at this SNP location, or who have at least one A allele (AG genotype), express the CYP3A5 enzyme. Therefore, when defining the *1 allele, this SNP is often mentioned as being crucial due to its impact on the enzyme's expression.     Hence, the rs776746 (A allele) is critical in the defintion of the CYP3A5 *1 allele status.	['rs776746']	1.0	0.2

This means it generally contains the consensus sequence without the specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that alter enzyme function found in other star alleles like CYP4F2 *2, *3, etc.    However, when referencing specific SNP information for the wild-type or *1 allele, it’s important to understand that it represents the variant without the functionally significant mutations known to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of drugs metabolized by CYP4F2. One commonly discussed SNP in other CYP4F2 alleles is rs2108622 (a SNP resulting in a Val433Met amino acid change), which defines the CYP4F2 *2 allele and is associated with altered warfarin metabolism. Thus, the CYP4F2 *1 allele would have the wild-type version of this SNP, which is rs2108622-T.    It should be noted that in pharmacogenetic testing and reporting, star allele nomenclature for an enzyme like CYP4F2 typically emphasizes those alleles with SNPs leading to altered enzyme activity compared to the wild-type allele. Therefore, the CYP4F2 *1 allele may not have specific rsIDs universally listed in literature or databases, as it is defined primarily by the absence of variants like rs2108622 (associated with *2) or other functionally significant SNPs.

Variants in the DPYD gene can affect enzyme functionality, altering drug metabolism and potentially leading to severe toxicity.    Several SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in the DPYD gene are important in pharmacogenomics, notably for their roles in predicting toxicity to fluoropyrimidine drugs. Here are some of the critical SNPs in the DPYD gene, commonly referred to in clinical and pharmacogenetic relevance:    1. **rs3918290** - This SNP is a G>A change (ClinVar Variation ID 5557) resulting in a splice site mutation (c.1905+1G>A), which leads to skipping of exon 14 and significantly reduced DPYD activity.    2. **rs55886062** - This SNP, also known as c.1679T>G or p.I560S, reduces enzyme activity. The variant allele G is associated with increased risk of severe drug toxicity.    3. **rs67376798** - Known as c.2846A>T or p.D949V, this SNP results in an amino acid substitution influential in enzyme function.    4. **rs75017182** - This variant, c.1236G>A or p.E412E, involves a synonymous mutation that might affect splicing and hence the enzyme levels.    These SNPs have been incorporated into allele definitions to guide dosing recommendations for fluoropyrimidine drugs. Importantly, not all populations have the same prevalence of these SNPs, and testing these genetic variations can identify individuals at higher risk for severe toxicity from standard dosing. Clinical guidelines, such as those from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC), recommend dose modifications based on the presence of these SNPs.    Note: Always ensure that the latest databases and guidelines are consulted, as the field of pharmacogenomics is continually evolving with new research findings.

This results in a complex allele where the exact structure varies, and it affects the MT-RNR1 gene, which is responsible for encoding the mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA that is crucial for the mitochondrial protein synthesis.    Regarding dbSNP IDs, the specific changes in the allele MT-RNR1 m.961T>del+Cn are not straightforward single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and therefore do not have typical SNP ID (rsID) representations in the dbSNP database. The dbSND database primarily catalogs simpler genetic variations such as single nucleotide variants, and thus more complex mtDNA mutations or rearrangements like deletions followed by insertions might not be directly catalogued with rsIDs.    For accessing more specific information or databases on mitochondrial mutations, you can consult resources like MITOMAP (a mitochondrial DNA database) or other specialized databases that focus on mitochondrial genetics. Understanding these complex variants typically involves analyzing their pathological implications and their impact on mitochondrial function, rather than looking up a simple SNP identifier in a database like dbSNP.

The rs9923231 SNP refers to a base change from guanine (G) to adenine (A) in the VKORC1 gene, where the ""T"" allele in question actually refers to the adenine or A allele at this position in the genomic DNA (transcribed to T in the mRNA). This polymorphism is important because it influences the promoter activity of VKORC1, impacting the enzyme's expression and consequently affecting individual sensitivity to warfarin, a commonly used anticoagulant."

VKORC1	rs9923231 reference (C)	What SNPs are in the allele definition for VKORC1 rs9923231 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available.	rs9923231	"The SNP rs9923231 is a well-known polymorphism in the VKORC1 gene that influences warfarin dosing. The rs number itself (rs9923231) is the dbSNP ID for this particular single nucleotide polymorphism. There are no additional SNPs within the definition of rs9923231; it specifically refers to a single nucleotide change at a particular position in the VKORC1 gene.    For the VKORC1 rs9923231 SNP:  - The reference allele is typically denoted as ""C.""  - The alternate allele, which is another common version, is denoted as ""T.""  - This SNP is primarily known for its role in altering the enzymatic activity of vitamin K epoxide reductase, which is crucial for the effective dosing of the anticoagulant drug warfarin.    Individuals who inherit the ""T"" allele (non-reference) typically require lower doses of warfarin due to increased sensitivity to the drug, influenced by reduced activity of the VKORC1 enzyme. This effect is significant enough that VKORC1 rs9923231 genotyping is often recommended prior to starting warfarin therapy to help tailor the initial dose.    Thus, the ""C"" allele represents the reference sequence at this genomic position, and this SNP by itself defines the genetic variation at this site without additional SNPs included in its definition."
