For an individual who has an ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype for CYP2D6 with an activity score of 2.5 and is a rapid metabolizer for CYP2C19, clinical guidance when prescribing amitriptyline suggests caution. Amitriptyline is metabolized primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6 enzymes. Given this genotypic profile, the individual may experience reduced efficacy of amitriptyline due to faster than normal metabolism, leading to lower plasma concentrations of the drug. Therefore, alternative medications not extensively metabolized by these enzymes might be considered, or careful monitoring and possible dose adjustments of amitriptyline may be required.	-0.09817622	0.1390373	0.011478219	-0.21211407	0.22670442	-0.033292476	-0.22715158760547638	0.31556421518325806	-0.017855308949947357	0.6517511307748992	0.580712599291103	0.589718203282467	0.63955885	0.56967175	0.5631953	0.6057817	0.64282966	0.6274333	0.5497853	0.566354	0.5590066	0.50700253	0.5588609	0.5172957	1

Imipramine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes. For an individual identified as a normal metabolizer (NM) for CYP2D6 with an activity score of 2.25, the metabolism of imipramine is expected to be efficient and within standard limits, thus regular dosing is typically appropriate. However, as an intermediate metabolizer (IM) for CYP2C19, the individual may experience slightly reduced metabolic activity for CYP2C19-dependent substrates, but this doesn't usually require dose adjustments for imipramine due to the compensatory normal activity of CYP2D6 in this case. Regular monitoring should be continued to manage any side effects or efficacy issues.	-0.3186606	0.093364336	-0.15240717	-0.27211455	0.10160384	-0.11627704	-0.2882113456726074	0.2767624855041504	-0.07644935697317123	0.35359355415358307	0.6239891176017557	0.6150247808357137	0.37284592	0.48795006	0.49371928	0.3301992	0.63259196	0.63642913	0.30466157	0.5806544	0.5712342	0.35892415	0.56636155	0.5153724	1

pantoprazole	CYP2C19	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer for CYP2C19 with regards to taking pantoprazole? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate standard starting daily dose. For chronic therapy (>12 weeks) and efficacy achieved, consider 50% reduction in daily dose and monitor for continued efficacy.	['Proceed taking pantoprazole as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Avoid pantoprazole. Take an alternate therapy.']	Take pantoprazole with an altered dose.	For an individual classified as an intermediate metabolizer of the enzyme CYP2C19, taking pantoprazole might result in somewhat elevated plasma levels of the drug due to reduced metabolic activity. However, pantoprazole generally has a wide therapeutic index, and typical dose adjustments are not routinely recommended solely based on CYP2C19 intermediate metabolizer status. Clinicians should monitor for typical side effects or adverse reactions but normal dosing can typically be used unless other factors suggest a different approach.	-0.05025619	0.1142066	0.029725581	-0.19377574	0.4251295	0.038707066	-0.1836940199136734	0.25880733132362366	-0.005298140924423933	0.34382420788364954	0.6815512070967367	0.6379319913310224	0.3250669	0.59511566	0.57585955	0.36637914	0.5670533	0.6474024	0.39073	0.5167827	0.5606001	0.40125075	0.6062508	0.5296229	0

For someone identified as a normal metabolizer (NM) with a CYP2D6 activity score of 2.25, tramadol is expected to be metabolized effectively. As a NM for CYP2D6, the individual has normal enzymatic activity, which means that the conversion of tramadol to its active metabolite, O-desmethyltramadol, will occur at a typical rate. Therefore, standard dosing regimens of tramadol can be followed, as the efficacy and risk of side effects should align with those observed in the general population. However, it remains important to monitor for efficacy and adverse effects since individual response can vary due to factors other than CYP2D6 activity.	-0.17266299	0.20572777	-0.012388055	-0.22757602	0.057598304	-0.101239726	-0.24637210369110107	0.3529532253742218	-0.024629367515444756	0.5264678209394044	0.5639237365060948	0.5525757652346354	0.4331765	0.40956342	0.41370583	0.57143843	0.59642404	0.6076936	0.5989586	0.5727184	0.56356686	0.58041185	0.6041104	0.5153031	1

Clinical guidance for such patients may involve considering alternative antidepressants not predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 or careful monitoring and dose adjustments based on therapeutic response and side effect profile.	0.0002915498	0.28937623	0.13110037	-0.22665843	0.024178715	-0.11303491	-0.17171086370944977	0.4145124554634094	0.05266137421131134	0.5786559111193152	0.5511171224261429	0.665335307134404	0.38826057	0.51537263	0.57331645	0.58149457	0.5217178	0.562727	0.5414275	0.51486534	0.54379284	0.5087178	0.5394473	0.58968455	0
venlafaxine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Normal Metabolizer and activity score = 1.75 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking venlafaxine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid venlafaxine.

For individuals with a CYP2D6 normal metabolizer status and an activity score of 1.75, standard dosing regimens of venlafaxine are generally recommended. Normal metabolizers will likely metabolize venlafaxine at a typical rate, allowing the conversion of venlafaxine to its active metabolite, desvenlafaxine, efficiently. Thus, there is no need for dose adjustments based solely on CYP2D6 metabolic status in these individuals, as they are expected to respond typically to the standard dosages prescribed for depression or anxiety.	-0.22868311	0.06445239	-0.09947966	-0.13635036	0.20025492	0.010186776	-0.1698644608259201	0.393122136592865	0.04791370406746864	0.378850275160192	0.6406696374112265	0.6327579839790468	0.44144636	0.55325794	0.49268663	0.40188998	0.59314066	0.5733093	0.4183408	0.6007489	0.5625642	0.4025356	0.61666304	0.5474336	1

Take an alternate therapy.	Individuals identified as poor metabolizers (PMs) for the CYP2C19 enzyme may experience higher plasma levels of voriconazole, which could increase the risk of toxicity. Clinical guidance for these patients typically recommends close monitoring for adverse effects and considering a reduction in the standard dose of voriconazole. If feasible, therapeutic drug monitoring is advised to ensure plasma concentrations remain within the therapeutic range, thereby optimizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity.	0.22005174	0.18298768	0.20446406	-0.06980391	0.27954024	0.082549304	-0.07452743500471115	0.45722994208335876	0.13871446251869202	0.7637302656240178	0.6073036022190227	0.6368231980910375	0.6067905	0.5670086	0.5153892	0.8265503	0.6135992	0.5952571	0.699259	0.48112345	0.47297844	0.6835283	0.6462497	0.66867304	0
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer and activity score = 0.75 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.	For an individual who is an intermediate metabolizer (IM) for CYP2D6 with an activity score of 0.75, there are currently no specific dosage adjustments recommended for vortioxetine based solely on this genotype. Vortioxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, but it is also metabolized by other enzymes such as CYP3A4/5. Therefore, while the metabolic rate may be slightly decreased in intermediate metabolizers, vortioxetine's metabolism through multiple pathways may compensate. Clinical monitoring for effectiveness and side effects is recommended, but standard dosing can generally be initiated.	-0.26457378	0.15224786	-0.09466096	-0.2146553	0.20110178	-0.043279476	-0.22988936305046082	0.3777276575565338	-0.0028081657364964485	0.40931110979530977	0.6056312617221413	0.6521104849409319	0.28987178	0.607848	0.5138204	0.37594557	0.65176713	0.6447901	0.42492697	0.5966825	0.57738894	0.371184	0.568512	0.58974004	1
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Ultrarapid Metabolizer and activity score = ≥3.0 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Select alternative drug not predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6. If vortioxetine use is warranted, initiate therapy at standard starting dose and titrate to maintenance dose based on efficacy and side effects. Increasing the target maintenance dose by 50% or more may be needed for efficacy.	['Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.	Vortioxetine metabolism is primarily facilitated by the CYP2D6 enzymatic pathway. In individuals who are classified as Ultrarapid Metabolizers of CYP2D6 (with an activity score of ≥3.0), the metabolism of vortioxetine is significantly accelerated. This increased metabolic rate may lead to subtherapeutic plasma concentrations of the drug, potentially reducing its efficacy. Therefore, clinical guidance for such individuals may involve close monitoring of therapeutic response and considering a higher dose of vortioxetine, with careful management to avoid adverse effects, or an alternative medication not predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6.	0.09601637	0.21685463	0.15684274	-0.17049	0.22922772	-0.0029807189	-0.1838846355676651	0.36715665459632874	0.030122552067041397	0.7846277816595363	0.621178420800786	0.6789750742242738	0.64444506	0.60392475	0.53986126	0.7496559	0.6982315	0.66032577	0.76968837	0.56813574	0.5191022	0.6863269	0.666447	0.6745463	1
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer and activity score = 1.0 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.	For an individual identified as an intermediate metabolizer (IM) of CYP2D6 with an activity score of 1.0, standard dosing of vortioxetine can generally be used, as vortioxetine metabolism is not significantly impacted by CYP2D6. Clinical studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of vortioxetine are unaffected by variations in CYP2D6 activity. Therefore, no specific dose adjustments are recommended for CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers when prescribing vortioxetine.	-0.28581566	0.059755184	-0.1396951	-0.1676908	0.18662068	-0.015569349	-0.20463396608829498	0.3276289999485016	-0.001633231877349317	0.40074161629933786	0.5981799882962696	0.6244725313926234	0.43166023	0.6444162	0.6156614	0.40485868	0.66759664	0.63138145	0.43102235	0.6058635	0.5796293	0.37948513	0.5581974	0.5736096	1
vortioxetine	CYP2D6	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Intermediate Metabolizer and activity score = 0.5 for CYP2D6 with regards to taking vortioxetine? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Initiate therapy with recommended starting dose.	['Avoid vortioxetine. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take vortioxetine with a reduced dose.', 'Take vortioxetine with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking vortioxetine as normal. There is no recommendation.	For patients identified as intermediate metabolizers (IM) with an activity score of 0.5 for the CYP2D6 enzyme and prescribed vortioxetine, clinicians should consider the potential for altered pharmacokinetics. As CYP2D6 plays a role in metabolizing vortioxetine, patients with reduced enzyme activity (like IMs) may experience increased plasma levels of the drug, potentially leading to greater side effects. Consequently, it may be advisable to initiate treatment at the lower end of the normal dosing range and adjust based on clinical response and tolerability.	-0.14747022	0.31535453	0.041335057	-0.16826174	0.080997914	-0.054555707	-0.1253635734319687	0.4098464846611023	0.08678004890680313	0.43823186997037794	0.5671334374279242	0.6692253416296919	0.3283855	0.53193694	0.5650538	0.35036334	0.620718	0.64306515	0.41000634	0.56222254	0.56521565	0.43679586	0.55771846	0.61685616	0
