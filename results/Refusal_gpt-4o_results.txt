What SNPs are in the allele definition for QSTG1 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	True		"I am unable to find information on an allele definition specifically labeled as ""QSTG1 reference (C)."" It’s possible that this specific terminology or allele is not recognized in my current databases or references.    If you have more specific information or context related to the allele or gene in question, providing that can help narrow down the search. Alternatively, consulting specialized genetic databases or recent literature may provide more detailed and updated information regarding specific alleles and their associated SNPs."	Unfortunately, I could not find specific information on an allele named QSTG1 reference (C) in public and widely recognized pharmacogenomics databases or literature sources. Alleles and their associated SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) definitions are usually cataloged with reference to specific genes or gene variations observed in studies.    For drug metabolism or pharmacogenomics-related queries, alleles and their haplotypes (combinations of SNPs) are often characterized for genes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C19, or VKORC1, among others. These alleles are defined based on several key SNPs, each identified with a respective rsID.    Would you be able to provide more context or specify the gene or drug of interest? With more details, I may better assist you in identifying the relevant SNPs and their dbSNP IDs.	True	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for CYP2C19 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	True		"For the CYP2C19 gene, the reference allele, often termed as CYP2C19*1, is considered the ""normal"" or wild-type allele. In this context, the reference allele does not include any single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated with altered enzyme activity. Therefore, the absence of notable SNPs characterizes this allele.    If we are specifically discussing the changes responsible for defining other alleles such as CYP2C19*2 or CYP2C19*3, we refer to the specific SNPs that differentiate these alleles from the reference (CYP2C19*1):    1. **CYP2C19*2**: Features the SNP c.681G>A (rs4244285).  2. **CYP2C19*3**: Features the SNP c.636G>A (rs4986893).    For the reference allele CYP2C19*1, since it represents the wild-type without these alteration mutations, specific SNP IDs would not apply, as it's the absence of these SNPs that defines the reference."	CYP2C19 is a gene that encodes an enzyme involved in the metabolism of several important drugs. Variants in the CYP2C19 gene can influence how individuals respond to medications metabolized by this enzyme. The reference allele (wild-type) for CYP2C19 is often denoted as CYP2C19*1.    Here are some of the notable single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with various CYP2C19 alleles:    1. **CYP2C19*2**: This is a non-functional allele that includes a splice defect due to a SNP. The common SNP for CYP2C19*2 is:     - **rs4244285** (c.681G>A)    2. **CYP2C19*3**: This is another non-functional allele caused by a stop codon (nonsense mutation). The common SNP for CYP2C19*3 is:     - **rs4986893** (c.636G>A)    3. **CYP2C19*17**: This allele is associated with increased enzyme activity and is identified by a SNP in the promoter region. The common SNP for CYP2C19*17 is:     - **rs12248560** (c.-806C>T)    The reference CYP2C19*1 allele does not have these SNPs and represents the haplotype with no known variant that affects enzyme function. Therefore, there are no specific dbSNP IDs associated with the reference allele in terms of functionality comparisons, as it denotes the wild-type (normal) condition in the absence of the known variants mentioned above.    However, the other variant alleles like CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, and CYP2C19*17 have been well-documented with the rsIDs mentioned.	False	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for APOE *2/*2 reference (C)? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	True		The APOE gene has various alleles, of which the *2/*2 genotype is one. This genotype refers to having two copies of the APOE *2 allele. The primary single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are used to define the APOE alleles are:    1. rs429358  2. rs7412    For APOE *2, the following SNPs are key:    - **rs429358:** T (Cys at position 112)  - **rs7412:** T (Cys at position 158)    The definition of the APOE *2/*2 genotype means that the individual has the T allele at both rs429358 and rs7412 in both copies of the APOE gene.	The APOE gene (apolipoprotein E) has several well-known allelic variants that are associated with lipid metabolism and various health conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's disease. The APOE *2 allele is one of these variants, and it is defined by specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To note, an individual with the genotype *2/*2 has two copies of the APOE *2 allele.    Here are the key SNPs associated with the APOE *2 allele:    1. **rs429358**: This SNP results in an amino acid substitution at position 130 of the protein (according to the Uniprot numbering) from cysteine to arginine. For the APOE *2 allele, the nucleotide at this position is T, resulting in cysteine.  2. **rs7412**: This SNP results in an amino acid substitution at position 176 of the protein from arginine to cysteine. For the APOE*2 allele, the nucleotide at this position is T, resulting in cysteine.    In the APOE *2/*2 genotype, both copies of the gene would have the following:  - rs429358: T/T   - rs7412: T/T     These SNPs are critical for distinguishing the APOE *2 allele from the other APOE alleles (*3 and *4).

What SNPs are in the allele definition for G6PD Gond? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The allele G6PD Gond is associated with the following SNPs:    1. c.637A>G, which corresponds to the p.His213Arg (historically known as His201Arg in some literature) mutation. The dbSNP ID for this is **rs1555904632**.  2. c.703C>T, corresponding to the p.Ser235Phe (historically p.Ser223Phe). This SNP is not listed in the dbSNP database, hence its dbSNP ID is **UNKNOWN**.    These SNPs together define the G6PD Gond variant.	G6PD Gond is a specific variant of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene, which is associated with G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency can lead to conditions such as hemolytic anemia, particularly in response to certain stressors like infections or certain medications. The G6PD gene has multiple variants, and these variants are often defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).     For the G6PD Gond variant, the specific SNP involved is:    - c.1311C>T (rs2230037)    This SNP is located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the G6PD gene and is a commonly described polymorphism associated with many G6PD variants, including G6PD Gond. However, it's important to note that multiple SNPs or specific combinations of SNPs can define different G6PD variants, and the exact molecular definition of G6PD Gond may include additional specific SNPs or mutations defined in the clinical or research context.    For a comprehensive and detailed definition, it is often recommended to refer to specialized genetic databases or literature such as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) or ClinVar, which provide validated and curated information on genetic variations and their clinical significance.	True	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for CYP4F2 *1? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The CYP4F2 *1 allele represents the wild-type or reference sequence for the CYP4F2 gene. In the context of pharmacogenomics, this typically means that there are no variant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) defining this allele. Essentially, the *1 allele does not contain any of the known SNPs that are associated with other variant alleles like *2 or *3.    Therefore, the SNPs in the allele definition for CYP4F2 *1 are:    **SNPs: None (wild-type/reference allele)**  **dbSNP ID: UNKNOWN**    This means the *1 allele denotes the absence of variant SNPs that characterize other specific alleles.	"The CYP4F2 *1 allele is considered the reference or ""wild-type"" allele. In the context of pharmacogenomics, this means it is the version of the gene that is most common in the population and does not have the more common variants that impact drug metabolism.    There are no specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that define the CYP4F2 *1 allele because it is the standard, unaltered version of the gene against which other variants (such as *2, *3, etc.) are compared. The SNPs that define other alleles (like CYP4F2 *3, which is characterized by the rs2108622 SNP) are absent or in the reference form in the *1 allele.    Therefore, in terms of SNP identification, the CYP4F2 *1 allele does not contain unique SNPs that would be denoted by an rsID. It is characterized by the absence of alterations found in other alleles."	True	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for UGT1A1 *80+*37? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The allele UGT1A1 *80+*37 is defined by specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Here's the information on the SNPs for each allele:    - UGT1A1*80:    - c.864+3G>A (intron 1) - rs1078877841    - UGT1A1*37:    - c.-363T>C (promoter region) - rs4148326    - c.211G>A (exon 1) - rs4148323    - c.864+3A>G (intron 1) - rs1077170751    - c.1456T>G (exon 5) - UNKNOWN    - c.1517-113T>C (intronic region) - UNKNOWN    If a nucleotide change or SNP does not have a documented rsID, it is denoted as UNKNOWN.	The UGT1A1 *80+*37 allele is defined by specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, as of my last update, detailed allele definitions for combinations such as *80+*37 could be more complex and not always directly listed in public resources. It's essential to check the most recent databases and literature for precise definitions. Here are the SNPs typically associated with the individual alleles:    1. **UGT1A1*80**:     - rs873686 (c.-3279T>G)       2. **UGT1A1*37**:     - rs34983651 (c.211G>A, p.Gly71Arg)     - and a variable number of TA repeats in the promoter region.     For accurate and specific combinations like *80+*37, researchers generally refer to the most current allele-specific literature, haplotype studies, or dedicated pharmacogenomics resources like PharmGKB or CPIC guidelines.    It's advisable to double-check with professional genetic databases or peer-reviewed articles for the latest information, as allele definitions can be updated with new genomic discoveries. If you are conducting clinical interpretation or research, consulting with a geneticist or a specialist in pharmacogenomics may also be warranted for the most detailed and updated genetic information.	True	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G variant is a mitochondrial DNA mutation, and mitochondrial DNA mutations do not have dbSNP IDs (rsIDs) because dbSNP is primarily focused on nuclear DNA.    Therefore, for MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G, the answer to the request for a dbSNP ID is UNKNOWN.	The MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G variant refers to a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene (MT-RNR1). This mutation is associated with increased susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced deafness and some cases of non-syndromic hearing loss.    The dbSNP ID (rsID) for MT-RNR1 m.1555A>G is rs267606617.     As it involves mitochondrial DNA, rather than nuclear DNA, the nomenclature and the way SNPs are cataloged might slightly differ from those located in nuclear DNA, but they are still accessible through the same dbSNP database.	True	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for MT-RNR1 m.1494C>T? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The SNP in the allele definition for MT-RNR1 m.1494C>T does not have a corresponding dbSNP ID (rsID). Therefore, the answer is UNKNOWN.	The MT-RNR1 m.1494C>T variant in the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene is associated with susceptibility to aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that defines this allele is the m.1494C>T mutation itself.    As of my latest update, mitochondrial SNPs in MT-RNR1, including m.1494C>T, generally do not have dbSNP IDs like nuclear DNA SNPs do. Instead, they are traditionally referenced by their mitochondrial genome position and nucleotide change. Therefore, there is no dbSNP ID (rsID) for MT-RNR1 m.1494C>T.    If you need further details, reviewing specialized mitochondrial databases or mitochondrial variant reporting literature might be helpful for the most recent information.	True	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for CYP3A5 *6? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The CYP3A5*6 allele is defined by the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The specific SNP for CYP3A5*6 is:    - 14690A>G (or g.14690A>G).    The associated dbSNP ID for this SNP is **rs10264272**.    If you need information on the functional implications of this allele or other related CYP3A5 alleles, please let me know!	The CYP3A5 *6 allele is characterized by a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that affects the function of the CYP3A5 enzyme. Specifically, the SNP for CYP3A5 *6 involves:    - A single nucleotide change from G to A at position 14690 in intron 3 of the gene.    The corresponding dbSNP ID (rsID) for this polymorphism is rs10264272. This variant leads to aberrant splicing and consequently reduces the production of functional CYP3A5 protein.	False	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for TPMT *34? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		TPMT *34 is defined by the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):    1. c.645T>A, which is referenced as dbSNP ID rs1800462.  2. c.719A>G, which is referenced as dbSNP ID rs1142345.    These SNPs are involved in the gene encoding thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), and variations in these positions can influence the enzyme's activity and, therefore, an individual's response to thiopurine drugs.	As of the latest information available, the allele TPMT *34 is defined by a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). For TPMT *34, the following genetic variation is present:    - **TPMT *34:** The SNP associated with this allele is **rs79286906**, which corresponds to a c.496G>T change in the TPMT gene sequence.    This information can be validated and updated by consulting reliable databases such as the Pharmacogene Variation (PharmVar) Consortium or dbSNP for the most recent allele definitions and corresponding SNPs.	False	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for DPYD c.1990G>T? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		The DPYD c.1990G>T variant corresponds to the dbSNP ID rs3918290. This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) results in the substitution of guanine (G) with thymine (T) at position 1990 of the DPYD gene, leading to a missense mutation. Having this mutation can impact enzymatic activity and influence drug metabolism, particularly for fluoropyrimidine drugs like 5-fluorouracil.	The DPYD c.1990G>T variant is also known by the synonym DPYD*9A. This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) changes the nucleotide at position 1990 from a Guanine (G) to a Thymine (T). The dbSNP ID for this variant is rs118194698.    Thus, the SNP in the allele definition for DPYD c.1990G>T is:  - rs118194698    This SNP can have pharmacogenomic implications, particularly in the context of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy treatments, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine, due to its potential impact on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity.	False	False
What SNPs are in the allele definition for G6PD Coimbra Shunde? Provide a dbSNP ID (also known as an rsID, starting with rs) when available or answer UNKNOWN if unknown.	allele_def	False		"The G6PD Coimbra Shunde variant is not an officially recognized or standardized allele designation in pharmacogenomics databases such as PharmGKB or dbSNP. Therefore, providing specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or dbSNP IDs for it isn’t feasible based on standard resources.    However, if there are specific SNPs identified in independent research studies for this variant, they might be reported in gene-specific literature or clinical reports. If you're looking for such data, I recommend consulting specialized databases or publications related to G6PD (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) deficiency variants.    For more accurate and useful information, it would be best to refer to peer-reviewed scientific literature or specific genetic testing results where the ""G6PD Coimbra Shunde"" variant might be described in detail."	"The G6PD variant referred to as ""G6PD Coimbra Shunde"" is associated with a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the G6PD gene. G6PD (Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase) is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, and variations in this gene can lead to different levels of enzyme activity which are clinically significant, particularly in the context of conditions such as G6PD deficiency.    G6PD Coimbra (Shunde) is characterized by a nucleotide change at position 592 of the coding sequence, resulting in an amino acid substitution from Arginine (R) to Cysteine (C) at position 198 (p.R198C).     The dbSNP ID for this specific variant (p.R198C) is rs72554665.    To summarize:  - SNP: c.592C>T (leading to p.R198C)  - dbSNP ID (rsID): rs72554665"	False	False
