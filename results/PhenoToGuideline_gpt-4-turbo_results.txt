Individuals with an indeterminate G6PD status are potentially at risk for hemolytic anemia, a condition where red blood cells are destroyed more quickly than they are made. Although there is no direct contraindication for taking aspirin in individuals with G6PD deficiency, caution is advisable because aspirin has been associated with hemolysis in patients with this condition, especially at higher doses. Hence, clinical guidance would typically involve considering alternative medications that have a lower risk of inducing hemolysis and closely monitoring for symptoms of anemia if aspirin use is deemed necessary.	0.6232288891787019	0.33288404041990965	0.2828415120114278	0.47869065487397916	0.46918687	0.15246576	0.1356938	0.5030168	0.57847655	0.14822087	0.043561477	0.49492407	0.5290918	0.10093928	0.07276488	0.42900634	0.47192734	0.3910955	0.37708566	0.5286778	0

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cell function, particularly in response to certain stressors like infections, certain foods, and some medications. Aspirin is known to be an oxidative stressor that can potentially trigger hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency. However, if someone has a normal G6PD level (non-deficient), there is generally no increased risk of hemolysis from aspirin intake, so clinical guidance would not typically include special precautions regarding aspirin use based on G6PD status alone. However, other factors should be considered when recommending aspirin therapy, such as gastrointestinal risk and cardiovascular health.	0.6427115970839347	0.38012272463083585	0.2635640942934305	0.41617451034582464	0.35261518	0.3738107	0.16683589	0.39579532	0.4292073	0.24273354	0.09404412	0.47621593	0.40429372	0.088122874	0.028731184	0.40582827	0.28105503	0.41270486	0.29584396	0.24441932	1

Clomipramine is primarily metabolized via the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. For someone identified as an Intermediate Metabolizer (IM) for CYP2D6 with an activity score of 1.0, there may be diminished enzymatic activity leading to potentially higher plasma concentrations of clomipramine, which could increase the risk of side effects or toxicity. In contrast, being a Rapid Metabolizer (RM) for CYP2C19 might slightly enhance the clearance of clomipramine but is unlikely to compensate fully for the reduced function of CYP2D6. Therefore, for such a patient, it would be prudent to initiate clomipramine at a lower dose than normal, closely monitor for adverse effects and effectiveness, and consider dose adjustment based on clinical response and tolerability.	0.7549957814109886	0.7431669404312972	0.6899612460031118	0.6399159678482689	0.6789556	0.62268287	0.5216867	0.5266832	0.81011343	0.64054334	0.5394547	0.6715604	0.79190755	0.63897115	0.61448556	0.6175756	0.7409142	0.6680724	0.629466	0.59761256	0

For an individual with an indeterminate CYP2C9 genotype and a possible decreased function in SLCO1B1, the clinical guidance when considering fluvastatin would generally prioritize caution. SLCO1B1 is involved in the hepatic uptake of fluvastatin, and a decrease in function could lead to higher plasma concentrations of the drug, potentially increasing the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy. Although CYP2C9 plays a lesser role in the metabolism of fluvastatin compared to other statins, the indeterminate status might still warrant closer monitoring for efficacy and side effects. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes and muscle symptoms is recommended, and dosage adjustments may be necessary based on clinical response and tolerance.	0.8214261818270953	0.6064374174183249	0.6522115439883961	0.5637343636847656	0.78359884	0.5956503	0.5552284	0.51609963	0.8582385	0.67909634	0.5395389	0.59618145	0.7227633	0.5476325	0.5157771	0.5049532	0.70663583	0.6026437	0.6182136	0.51729393	0

For an individual with a CYP2C9 normal metabolizer status (activity score = 2.0), the expected metabolic activity of CYP2C9 is standard, suggesting dosing adjustments for fluvastatin are typically not needed based on CYP2C9 activity alone. However, with a decreased function status of SLCO1B1, which encodes for a transporter protein involved in hepatic uptake of statins including fluvastatin, there is a potential for increased plasma levels of fluvastatin, which could raise the risk of adverse effects, such as myopathy. Therefore, clinical guidance would likely include careful monitoring for statin-related side effects, and consideration might be given to adjusting the fluvastatin dose or selecting an alternative statin less dependent on SLCO1B1 for hepatic uptake.	0.7005195781172443	0.638203655062093	0.6908823729792118	0.5962925307730286	0.5046975	0.50806916	0.53615195	0.5569818	0.5412331	0.65729254	0.4876262	0.58186597	0.5386444	0.5292073	0.51502293	0.536132	0.61491287	0.5800474	0.6020532	0.6160304	0

However, since medication responses can vary significantly among individuals, it is advisable for patients with G6PD deficiency to consult healthcare providers before starting any new medication, including ofloxacin, to discuss potential risks and monitor for any adverse reactions.	0.4022664213980335	0.3723324677373823	0.39830062533220273	0.5463041723334102	0.42648628	0.47258335	0.47498974	0.60387594	0.3818317	0.4311583	0.40081978	0.5799225	0.4635467	0.44066787	0.40350303	0.5384827	0.36816123	0.41272175	0.49330428	0.5518237	0
ofloxacin	G6PD	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is Normal for G6PD with regards to taking ofloxacin? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	No reason to avoid based on G6PD status	['Avoid ofloxacin. Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take ofloxacin with a reduced dose.', 'Take ofloxacin with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking ofloxacin as normal. There is no recommendation.	The glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) enzyme is primarily known for its role in protecting red blood cells from oxidative damage. Ofloxacin is an antibiotic that generally does not cause hemolysis unless in cases of overdose, and thus does not specifically depend on G6PD activity, unlike some other drugs such as certain antimalarials or sulfa drugs which can trigger hemolysis in G6PD-deficient patients. Therefore, a normal G6PD status does not affect the clinical use of ofloxacin, and standard dosing and monitoring recommendations can be followed without special modifications for G6PD activity.	0.5503809262550412	0.3386969590145985	0.2210343181188719	0.46335222893232975	0.36839858	0.4036584	0.21641769	0.39777333	0.34978968	0.2645305	0.14745687	0.57418334	0.36404502	0.12907806	0.053062085	0.44886956	0.5202454	0.38018793	0.2693993	0.54325783	1

Individuals identified as likely intermediate metabolizers of CYP2C19 may have reduced enzymatic activity, impacting the metabolism of drugs like omeprazole. For omeprazole, which is metabolized by CYP2C19, this could lead to higher plasma concentrations, potentially increasing the risk of side effects such as headache, nausea, or stomach pain. Clinical guidance may suggest considering a reduced dose of omeprazole or opting for an alternative medication not predominantly metabolized by CYP2C19 to avoid adverse effects.	0.3479959395124965	0.4312387054737586	0.41026541277960105	0.6406076276335944	0.1831449	0.4274976	0.38631967	0.5003347	0.18623647	0.39290318	0.40172082	0.51223624	0.21254316	0.40408826	0.4260251	0.5100004	0.31752837	0.51069117	0.39541346	0.56898934	0

For an individual identified as an ultrarapid metabolizer of CYP2D6 (activity score ≥6.0), the use of ondansetron might be less effective due to the enhanced metabolism of the drug. Ondansetron is metabolized partly by CYP2D6, and increased enzyme activity could lead to lower plasma concentrations of the drug, potentially reducing its efficacy in preventing nausea and vomiting. In such cases, clinicians might consider alternative antiemetic agents that are not significantly metabolized by CYP2D6 or adjusting the dosage according to clinical response and tolerability.	0.5473680468126587	0.6061238391352334	0.47323810526323395	0.6159189817865721	0.6167177	0.5319946	0.4777294	0.56982726	0.6760462	0.4176924	0.3991066	0.5528932	0.72255164	0.5270999	0.52874094	0.5793513	0.59769166	0.57994187	0.5272296	0.6020274	0

There is no recommendation.	For patients with an indeterminate SLCO1B1 genotype, the clinical guidelines specifically for prescribing pravastatin are not fully established, as most studies and recommendations focus primarily on the impact of SLCO1B1 genetic variations on simvastatin-induced myopathy. Since pravastatin is less affected by SLCO1B1 transporter function compared to other statins like simvastatin, the impact of an indeterminate SLCO1B1 genotype on pravastatin pharmacokinetics and associated risks (e.g., myopathy) is likely minimal. Clinicians might consider regular monitoring and adherence to standard dosing guidelines while being cautious about potential adverse effects, but specific adjustments based solely on SLCO1B1 status are generally not necessary for pravastatin.	0.23364387271914389	0.4605310803309176	0.2121467677977377	0.5634825580053109	0.12349801	0.30104128	0.14220761	0.5345267	0.03576254	0.18772747	0.07142186	0.590336	-0.023367317	0.28907138	0.06006204	0.46106747	0.2645603	0.5008195	0.40348327	0.5435573	0
