abacavir	HLA-B	What would be the clinical guidance for someone who is HLA-B*57:01 positive for HLA-B with regards to taking abacavir? Give a 2-3 sentence summary.	Abacavir is not recommended	['Proceed taking abacavir as normal. There is no recommendation.', 'Take abacavir with a reduced dose.', 'Take abacavir with an increased dose.']	Avoid abacavir. Take an alternate therapy.	According to clinical guidelines, individuals who are HLA-B*57:01 positive should not be prescribed abacavir due to the increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions, including potentially life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. This recommendation is based on strong evidence from multiple studies, including a pivotal trial that demonstrated a significant association between HLA-B*57:01 and abacavir hypersensitivity. Prior to initiating abacavir therapy, HLA-B*57:01 screening is recommended to minimize the risk of adverse reactions.	-0.15602238	0.40721974	0.06586788	-0.113034576	0.33401787	0.07338262	tensor(-0.1156)	tensor(0.3007)	tensor(0.0444)	0.6936743209271073	0.6174761448497603	0.7600543178364253	0.7619032	0.6165029	0.81565624	0.71076334	0.661281	0.8705849	0.5352655	0.53238547	0.81285465	0.6337547	0.65249217	0.7781236	1

Take an alternate therapy.', 'Take abacavir with a reduced dose.', 'Take abacavir with an increased dose.']	Proceed taking abacavir as normal. There is no recommendation.	For individuals who are HLA-B*57:01 negative, the clinical guidance is to proceed with cautious use of abacavir, as they are not at increased risk of developing hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) associated with HLA-B*57:01. However, it is still important to monitor for signs and symptoms of HSR, as it can occur in HLA-B*57:01 negative individuals, albeit at a lower frequency. Close clinical monitoring and prompt discontinuation of abacavir if HSR is suspected are recommended.	-0.18658999	0.22977214	-0.012618742	-0.12563978	0.2745001	0.044383686	tensor(-0.1539)	tensor(0.3209)	tensor(0.0394)	0.6409250900414972	0.6205953431956335	0.7523120277915231	0.56465036	0.6607829	0.66466814	0.60438055	0.6371266	0.7724148	0.48212665	0.46755123	0.74568725	0.54253644	0.50355947	0.68976	0

According to clinical guidelines, individuals who are HLA-B*58:01 positive should avoid taking allopurinol due to the significantly increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The FDA recommends genetic testing for HLA-B*58:01 before initiating allopurinol therapy, and alternative treatments should be considered for HLA-B*58:01-positive patients. This is based on robust evidence from multiple studies demonstrating a strong association between HLA-B*58:01 and allopurinol-induced SCARs.	-0.15827556	0.1987398	-0.004188068	-0.120466284	0.37755966	0.082510434	tensor(-0.1274)	tensor(0.2737)	tensor(0.0280)	0.659437304819551	0.6252110717409707	0.7334331181180042	0.73850363	0.5800401	0.7339339	0.6291635	0.5802632	0.78995836	0.44239378	0.52451116	0.6430116	0.6652067	0.63738936	0.6872222	1

According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, individuals with an uncertain risk of aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss due to MT-RNR1 variants (e.g., m.1555A>G, m.1494C>T) should be closely monitored for ototoxicity when treated with amikacin. While the evidence is not strong enough to recommend avoidance of amikacin, audiometric testing and careful monitoring for signs of hearing loss are recommended, especially in patients with pre-existing hearing impairment or those receiving high doses or prolonged therapy.

There is no recommendation.	According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should avoid taking aminosalicylic acid, as it can increase the risk of hemolytic anemia. This is because aminosalicylic acid can exacerbate the underlying G6PD deficiency, leading to severe hemolysis. Instead, alternative treatments should be considered, and patients should be closely monitored for signs of hemolytic anemia if aminosalicylic acid is deemed necessary.	-0.10696409	0.15362048	0.011692365	-0.02691992	0.26660985	0.10543172	tensor(-0.0188)	tensor(0.4353)	tensor(0.1726)	0.6051536277489995	0.5646837470235394	0.3628768605253921	0.62840724	0.6631659	0.45775127	0.6274545	0.63604367	0.3852969	0.55502254	0.59708685	0.36039174	0.54065406	0.58009785	0.42451632	0

According to the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guidelines, individuals who are indeterminate for G6PD deficiency should be treated as if they have G6PD deficiency, and therefore, should avoid taking aminosalicylic acid (ASA) or other oxidant drugs that can trigger hemolytic anemia. This is because ASA can cause hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency, and the indeterminate result may indicate a reduced G6PD enzyme activity. As a precautionary measure, alternative medications should be considered, and the patient should be closely monitored for signs of hemolysis.	0.05215089	0.30008405	0.16692689	-0.10737214	0.30909532	0.068762966	tensor(-0.0979)	tensor(0.4770)	tensor(0.1302)	0.6788466089300839	0.5402538535096828	0.301519857334226	0.50756145	0.6482248	0.32068476	0.6750787	0.57738537	0.33260477	0.61152816	0.50793743	0.25907266	0.56452835	0.513669	0.4185267	0

This means that the patient can be initiated on and maintained at standard doses of atorvastatin, with regular monitoring of lipid profiles and liver enzymes as recommended by the FDA label.	-0.14046721	0.11134091	-0.025581531	-0.0821758	0.26878065	0.071144275	tensor(-0.1063)	tensor(0.3400)	tensor(0.0758)	0.31589562284137007	0.5999525602021157	0.38486914070619466	0.40566683	0.5290997	0.44341806	0.45445064	0.64472556	0.3772863	0.3770165	0.5682266	0.38324484	0.49734312	0.63390136	0.6314302	1

Additionally, close monitoring of therapeutic response and potential adjustments to the dose or alternative medications may be necessary to achieve optimal treatment outcomes.	-0.24918115	0.045792215	-0.11927374	-0.10606562	0.23703794	0.043962292	tensor(-0.0920)	tensor(0.3769)	tensor(0.1024)	0.28138679587065313	0.6061243426647847	0.2899874767362205	0.29264623	0.5079756	0.25900793	0.24112307	0.5291461	0.17823517	0.1014618	0.4684282	0.115871325	0.2876741	0.6196204	0.47693428	0

Halogenated volatile anesthetics or the depolarizing muscle relaxant succinylcholine are relatively contraindicated in persons with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS).

Based on the available evidence, individuals with Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility (MHS) due to RYR1 mutations are at increased risk of developing malignant hyperthermia (MH) when exposed to triggering anesthetics, including methoxyflurane. As methoxyflurane is a known MH trigger, it is recommended to avoid its use in individuals with MHS due to RYR1 mutations.

However, it is essential to monitor for signs and symptoms of hemolysis, as rare cases of quinine-induced hemolytic anemia can still occur in individuals with normal G6PD activity.	-0.12892112	0.20220093	0.016313804	-0.0849082	0.295255	0.078954265	tensor(-0.1199)	tensor(0.3087)	tensor(0.0465)	0.61403280747198	0.632388314064328	0.3492633013539158	0.442849	0.6552088	0.23936793	0.32293934	0.6777206	0.15713121	0.34901565	0.51761764	0.1129773	0.5192294	0.5612109	0.35749537	1
